'''The Blitz''' refers to the German bombing of Britain, particularly [[London]], during World War II, which destroyed over a million homes and killed over 40,000 people.

The Blitz began in September 1940 and continued until May 1941.  ==References== {{reflist}}   {{history-stub}}  [[Category:Military of Germany]] [[Category:World War II]]</text>
