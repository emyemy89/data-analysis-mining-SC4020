Then about 13.8 [[billion]] years ago,<ref name=NASA /> [[Outer space|space]] expanded very quickly (thus the name "Big Bang"). This started the formation of atoms, which eventually led to the formation of stars and galaxies. It was [[Georges Lematre]] who first noted (in 1927) that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point. The universe is still expanding today, and getting colder as well.  As a whole, the universe is growing and the [[temperature]] is falling as [[time]] passes. [[Cosmology]] is the study of how the universe began and its development. [[Scientist]]s who study cosmology have agreed that the Big Bang theory matches what they have observed so far.<ref name=NASA />  [[Fred Hoyle]] called the theory the "Big Bang" on his radio show. He did not believe the Big Bang was correct. Scientists who did not agree with him thought the name was funny and decided to use it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/22/world/fred-hoyle-dies-at-86-opposed-big-bang-but-named-it.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Fred Hoyle dies at 86; opposed 'Big Bang' but named it |accessdate=2010-01-28 |last=Sullivan |first=Walter |date=August 22, 2001 |format= |work= |publisher=New York Times |pages= |quote= }}</ref>  [[Scientists]] base the Big Bang theory on many different [[observation]]s. The most important is the [[redshift]] of very far away [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Redshift is the [[Doppler effect]] occurring in light. When an object moves away from Earth, its color rays look more similar to the color red than they actually are, because the movement stretches the [[wavelength]] of light given off by the object. Scientists use the word "red hot" to describe this stretched light wave because red is the longest wavelength on the visible [[spectrum]]. The more redshift there is, the faster the object is moving away. By measuring the redshift, scientists proved that the universe is expanding, and they can work out how fast the object is moving away from the Earth. With very exact observation and measurements, scientists believe that the universe was a singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago. Because most things become [[cold]]er as they expand, scientists assume that the universe was very small and very hot when it started.<ref name=Michigan>{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/bigbang.htm |title=The Big Bang: it sure was BIG! |accessdate=2010-01-28 |authors=Chris LaRocco and Blair Rothstein  |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |quote= }}</ref>  Other observations that support the Big Bang theory are the amounts of [[chemical element]]s in the universe. Amounts of very light elements, such as [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], and [[lithium]] seem to agree with the theory of the Big Bang. Scientists also have found "cosmic [[microwaves]] [[wikt:background|background]] [[radiation]]". This radiation is known as radio waves, and they are everywhere in the universe. This radiation is now very weak and cold, but a long time ago it was very strong and very hot.<ref name=NASA />  It can be said that [[time]] had no meaning before the Big Bang. If the Big Bang was the beginning of time, then there was no universe before the Big Bang, since there could not be any "before" if there was no time! Other ideas state that the Big Bang was not the beginning of time 13.8 billion years ago. Instead, some believe that there was a completely different universe before the Big Bang, and it may have been very different from the one we know today.<ref name=Michigan />  Nonetheless, in November 2019, [[Jim Peebles]], awarded the 2019 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his theoretical discoveries in [[physical cosmology]].<ref name="SA-20191012">{{cite news |last=Hooper |first=Dan |title=A Well-Deserved Physics Nobel  Jim Peebles award honors modern cosmological theory at last |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/a-well-deserved-physics-nobel/ |date=12 October 2019 |work=[[Scientific American]] |accessdate=13 October 2019 }}</ref> noted, in his award presentation, that he does not support the Big Bang Theory, due to the lack of concrete supporting evidence, and stated, "It's very unfortunate that one thinks of the beginning whereas in fact, we have no good theory of such a thing as the beginning."<ref name="PHY-20191114">{{cite news |last=Couronne |first=Ivan |title=Top cosmologist's lonely battle against 'Big Bang' theory |url=https://phys.org/news/2019-11-cosmologist-lonely-big-theory.html |date=14 November 2019 |work=Phys.org |accessdate=15 November 2019 }}</ref>  == Graphical timeline of the universe == {{Nature timeline}} Many things happened in the first picosecond of the universe's time:  <timeline> ImageSize  = width:720 height:1000 PlotArea   = left:40 right:256 bottom:75 top:75  Colors =   id:period1  value:rgb(1,1,0.7) # light yellow   id:period2  value:rgb(0.7,0.7,1) # light blue   id:events   value:rgb(1,0.7,1) # light purple   id:era1     Value:yellowgreen   id:era2     value:lightorange   id:time1    Value:coral   id:time2    Value:lavender  DateFormat  = yyyy Period      = from:-430 till:155 TimeAxis    = format:yyyy orientation:vertical # order:reverse does not work ScaleMajor  = unit:year increment:10 start:-430 # second ScaleMinor  = unit:year increment:2 start:-430  AlignBars = justify  BarData =   bar:Clock   bar:Era   bar:Dummy3   bar:Periods   bar:Dummy4   bar:Events  TextData =   fontsize:M   pos:(240,75)   text:[[Planck epoch]]   pos:(250,50)   text:[[Big Bang]]   pos:(20,50)   text:"0: Linear time"   pos:(10,980)   text:"Logarithmic time:"   text:"10  log10 second"   pos:(154,946)   text:"NEXT"   pos:(117,931)   text:[[Graphical timeline of the Stelliferous Era|The Stelliferous Era]]   pos:(245,950)   text:"[[Reionization]]"  LineData =   layer:front   at:123  frompos:358 tillpos:369   width:0.5  # Matter domination   points:(369,878)(402,800)  width:0.5   points:(402,800)(413,800)  width:0.5  PlotData=   textcolor:black  fontsize:M    width:53   bar:Clock  color:events  align:right  shift:(28,3)  mark:(line,teal)   at:-120 text:"One picosecond"   at:-90  text:"One nanosecond"   at:-60  text:"One microsecond"   at:-30  text:"One millisecond"   at:0    text:"One second"   at:36   text:"One hour"   at:75   text:"One year"   at:105  text:"One thousand years"  shift:(43,3)   at:135  text:"One million years"    width:53   bar:Era  mark:(line,white)  align:center  shift:(0,0)   from:-430  till:135  color:era1  text:"[[The Five Ages of the Universe|The Primordial Era]]"    width:53   bar:Dummy3    width:158   bar:Periods  align:center  shift:(0,0)  mark:(line,white)   from:-430 till:-360 color:period1  text:[[Grand unification epoch]]   from:-360 till:-120 color:period2  text:[[Electroweak epoch]]   from:-120 till:-60  color:period1  text:[[Quark epoch]]   from:-60  till:0 shift:(-40,0) align:left  color:period2  text:[[Hadron epoch]]   from: 0   till:23   color:period1  text:[[Lepton epoch]]   from: 23   till:131  color:period2  text:[[Photon epoch]]   from:131  till:155  color:period1  text:"[[Timeline of the Big Bang#Dark Ages|Dark Ages]]"    width:53   bar:Dummy4    width:53   mark:(line, blue)  textcolor:black  fontsize:M   bar:Events  color:events  align:left  shift:(30,-4)    at:-430 shift:(30,-12) text:"[[Planck time]], the smallest theoretically observable ~unit of time and the time before which science is ~unable to describe the universe.
