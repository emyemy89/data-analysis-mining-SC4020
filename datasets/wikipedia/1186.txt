Portugal is the westernmost country of Europe and part of the Mediterranean.  It is bordered by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west and south and by [[Spain]] to the north and east.  It has been a member of the European Union since 1986.  It was under a dictatorship between 1926 and 1974.  It has since prospered but was hit hard by the 2007-2008 recession.  It has a football team and won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2017]] meaning it hosts the event for the first time ever in 2018.  It once had an empire and was a powerful maritime nation from 1500s1800s, the 10th-largest empire with a maximum land area of 10.4 million km which included [[Brazil]], Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, East Timoa, So Tom and Prncipe, Portuguese Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]) and even Macau in China (until 2002).  Three groups of [[island]]s in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] are also part of Portugal: the [[Azores]] (''Aores''), [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]] and the [[Savage Isles]] (''Ilhas Selvagens''). The Savage Isles are a small group of uninhabited islands, administered by Madeira. Portugal claims that [[Olivenza|Olivena]] is also part of its territory, but it is controlled by Spain.  It's a popular holiday destination but, is sometimes overlooked in favour of larger countries like France, Spain and Italy. The Algarve region in the south and capital Lisbon are the most popular.  == History == Portugal became its own [[kingdom]] in [[1139]] but was not officially recognized until [[1143]].  Portugal has had links with England since the 1100s via a treaty.  The border with [[Spain]] has been almost the same since the [[13th century]].  [[Fishing]] and [[trade]] with other countries are important here.  Portugal was important in world [[exploration]] for two reasons. [[Henry the Navigator]], a prince from Portugal, was very interested in exploration. [[Invention]]s in [[navigation]] led to a bigger knowledge of [[geography]].  This world exploration began the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Portugal was a [[world power]] during the [[15th century|15th]] and [[16th century|16th centuries]]. It tried to colonize Canada in the 16th century. However, it lost a lot of money soon after this. Portugal and Spain were in the [[Iberian Union]] from 1580 to 1640. The city of [[Lisbon]] was destroyed in an [[earthquake]] in [[1755]]. The country was [[occupation|occupied]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It lost its largest [[colony]], [[Brazil]], in [[1822]].  In [[1910]], Portugal became a [[Republic]], and in [[1926]], a [[military]] group took control of the country from the [[Portuguese 1st Republic]]. This began a time of [[rule]] by authoritarian [[government]]s. During [[World War II]] they were neutral but friendly to [[Great Britain|Britain]]. In 1974 a peaceful [[left-wing]] army [[coup]], called the ''[[Carnation Revolution]]'', happened. The coup changed how the country was run.  The next year, Portugal allowed its colonies in [[Africa]] to be on their own: [[Mozambique]], [[Angola]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Cape Verde]] and [[So Tom and Prncipe]].  [[East Timor]] in [[Asia]] declared itself independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975, and was invaded and occupied by [[Indonesia]]n forces nine days later.  Portugal went into the [[European Union]] in [[1986]]. Another [[Asian]] colony, [[Macau]], became part of [[China]]  The main language of Portugal is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].  Some famous Portuguese people are [[Afonso I of Portugal|D. Afonso Henriques]], [[Henry the Navigator]], [[Bartolomeu Dias]], [[Vasco da Gama]], [[Pedro lvares Cabral]], [[Ferdinand Magellan]], [[Lus de Cames]], [[Fernando Pessoa]], [[Amlia Rodrigues]], lvaro Siza Vieira, Eduardo Souto de Moura.  Lus de Cames wrote the national poem of Portugal. It is called ''Os Lusadas'' and was written in 1572.<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11198/ |title = The Lusiads |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1800-1882 |accessdate = 2013-09-02 }}</ref>  ==Related pages== * [[List of rivers of Portugal]] * [[Portugal at the Olympics]] * [[Portugal national football team]]  ==References== {{commons|Portugal}} {{Wikivoyage|Portugal}} {{reflist}}  {{Europe}} {{European Union}} {{North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)}}  [[Category:Portugal| ]] [[Category:Portuguese-speaking countries]] [[Category:European Union member states]] [[Category:1974 establishments in Europe]]</text>
