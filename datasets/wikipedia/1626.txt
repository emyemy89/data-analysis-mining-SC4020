<title>List of planets</title><text>This is a list of two types of planets: standard [[planet]]s and [[dwarf planet]]s, in the [[Solar System]].  == Planets in the Solar System == * [[Terrestrial planet]]s **[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]  The planet with the second highest temperature in the Solar System and the closest planet to the [[Sun]]. ** [[Venus]]  The warmest planet. Sometimes called "Earth's twin" because Venus and Earth are very similar. ** [[Earth]]  The only planet that is known to have life. It has one natural satellite, the [[Moon]]. ** [[Mars]]  Sometimes called the "red planet" and "the brother of Earth". ** [[Asteroid belt|Phaeton or Astra]]  a planet that some think broke apart to form the [[asteroid belt]], though most astronomers think it never formed. ** [[Pluto (dwarf planet)|Pluto]]  (''disputed'') Historically considered the smallest planet, Pluto is now considered a "[[Dwarf planet|Dwarf Planet]]" by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) when they developed a definition for "planet" on August 24, 2006.  Other organizations disagreed. ** [[Giant impact hypothesis|Theia]]  some scientists think this crashed into Earth once, creating the Moon. * [[Gas giant]]s **[[Jupiter]]  The largest planet in the Solar System. ** [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]  Sixth planet from the Sun. It has giant [[Rings of Saturn|rings]] around it. ** [[Uranus]] - Seventh planet from the Sun. It has 11 rings around it. ** [[Neptune]]  The farthest planet that we know from the Sun. ** Planet Nine  a hypothetical [[planets beyond Neptune|planet beyond Neptune]]. It has not been found, but some astronomers think its gravity pulls on the orbits of many dwarf planets.  It is thought to be a gas giant.  == Dwarf planets == * [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] is the largest [[asteroid]] (not mentioning [[plutino]]s) in the Solar System's main [[asteroid belt]]. * [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]] is shaped like an egg. * [[Makemake (dwarf planet)|Makemake]] crosses paths with Eris. * [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] follows the most [[Orbital eccentricity|elliptical path]] of any planet.  ==Exoplanets== ''See [[List of exoplanets]]''  ==Definition of a planet==  Technically, there was never a scientific definition of the term ''planet'' before 2006. When the Greeks observed the sky thousands of years ago, they discovered objects that acted differently than stars. These points of light seemed to wander around the sky throughout the year. The term "planet" is derived from the Greek word "planetes" - meaning wanderer.  in 2006 the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) convened a Planet Definition Committee, deliberated, and ultimately reached consensus on a new definition of planet which leaves us with the eight planets we today consider to comprise the Solar System (thus the exit of Pluto).  That new definition: " A planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit [meaning: 'there are no other bodies in its path that it must sweep up as it goes around the Sun'.]"  {{DEFAULTSORT:planets}} [[Category:Planets|*]] [[Category:Astronomy lists]]</text>
