[[Vladimir Lenin]] was a Russian [[Marxism|Marxist]]. He had a set of ideas based on [[Marxism]]. Lenin's development of Marxism has become known as '''Leninism'''. These ideas include:  * [[Democratic Centralism]], also known as the idea of the vanguard party.  Like other [[Communism|communists]],  Lenin wanted to see a socialist revolution led by the [[working class]].  But he thought the [[worker]]s needed strong leadership in the form of a Revolutionary Party based on Democratic Centralism.  Lenin wanted Communist [[political party|political parties]] in every country to lead the revolution.  He thought the vanguard party would need to have strong discipline, or it would fail.  * The idea that [[capitalism]] is the cause of [[imperialism]] (empire-building). He thought that imperialism was the "highest stage" of capitalism.  == Citations == [[Category:Communism]] [[Category:Marxism]] <references />{{politics-stub}}</text>
