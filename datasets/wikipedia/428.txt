<title>Right angle</title><text>[[File:Right angle.svg|thumb|The little [[Square (geometry)|square]] indicates that this is a right angle]] A '''right angle''' is an [[angle]] with a [[measurement]] of 90 [[degree (geometry)|degrees]]. When two [[line]]s cross each other so that all the angles have the same size, the result is four right angles. The top of the letter T is at right angles to the [[wikt:vertical|vertical]] line. [[Wall]]s of [[building]]s are usually at right angles to the [[floor]]. Two things that are at right angles are called "'''perpendicular'''" or "orthogonal". This is expressed using the <math>\bot</math> symbol (such as in <math>\ell_1 \, \bot \, \ell_2</math>).<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2020-04-17|title=List of Geometry and Trigonometry Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/geometry-trigonometry-symbols/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-21|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Perpendicular|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Perpendicular.html|access-date=2020-09-21|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Perpendicular - math word definition - Math Open Reference|url=https://www.mathopenref.com/perpendicular.html|access-date=2020-09-21|website=www.mathopenref.com}}</ref>  [[Plane (mathematics)|Planes]] (flat surfaces) can also meet at right angles.  In a building, a wall and a floor are said to be perpendicular to each other, and they have a right angle. It also can be called a square angle.  ==Related pages== * [[Acute angle]] * [[Obtuse angle]] * [[Parallel (geometry)]]  == References == <references />  {{math-stub}}  [[Category:Angles]]</text>
