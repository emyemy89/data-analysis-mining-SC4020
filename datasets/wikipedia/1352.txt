At the time, it was competing against the [[Nintendo 64]] and the [[Sega Saturn]]. PlayStation games were stored on [[CD-ROM|CD]]s. The controllers that were first released with the console had no [[analog signal|analog]] [[joystick]]s on them, but analog joysticks and a vibration feature were added to later controllers. A slimmer version of the console called the [[PSOne]] was released in 2000. It was white instead of grey.  ==Sales== The '''PlayStation''' and the PSOne have sold over 120 million consoles.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906225802/http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/data/bizdataps_e.html|title=Cumulative Production Shipments of Hardware(until March 2007)|publisher=Sony|accessdate=30 September 2014}} Archived from [http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/data/bizdataps_e.html the original]</ref>  ==Peripherals== ===PocketStation===  The PocketStation was a very small games console released as a [[peripheral]] (an extra accessory) for the PlayStation.
