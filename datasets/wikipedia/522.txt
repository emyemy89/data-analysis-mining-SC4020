The rings of Uranus are thought to be relatively young, not more than 600 million years old. The Uranian ring system probably began from the collisional fragmentation of moons that once existed around the planet. After colliding, the moons probably broke up into many particles, which survived as narrow, optically dense rings only in zones of maximum [[stability]].  === General properties === [[File:Uranian rings PIA01977.jpg |thumb|left |100px|Uranus's inner rings. The bright outer ring is the epsilon ring; eight other rings are visible.]]  The ring system of Uranus has thirteen distinct rings. In order of increasing distance from the planet they are: 1986U2R/, 6, 5, 4, , , , , , , , ,  rings. They can be divided into three groups: nine narrow main rings (6, 5, 4, , , , , , ), two dusty rings (1986U2R/, ) and two outer rings (, ). The rings of Uranus   consist mainly of macroscopic particles and  little [[dust]], although dust is known to be present in 1986U2R/, , , ,  and  rings.  In addition to these well-known rings, there may be numerous optically thin dust bands and faint rings between them. These faint rings and dust bands may exist only temporarily. Some of them became visible during a series of ring plane-crossing events in 2007.<ref name=dePater2007>{{cite journal |last=de Pater |first=Imke |author2= Hammel H.B. | display-authors = etal |title=The dark side of the rings of Uranus |journal= Science |year=2007 |volume=317 |pages=18881890 |url= http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007Sci...317.1888D |doi= 10.1126/science.1148103 |pmid= 17717152 |issue=5846}}</ref> A number of dust bands between the rings were observed in forward-scattering {{Ref_label|A|a|none}} geometry by ''[[Voyager 2]]''.  All rings of Uranus show [[azimuth]]al brightness variations.  The rings are made of an extremely dark material. The rings are slightly red in the [[ultraviolet]] and visible parts of the [[spectrum]] and grey in [[near-infrared]].<ref name=Baines1998>{{cite journal|last=Baines|first=Kevin H. | display-authors = etal  |title=Near-Infrared absolute photometric imaging of the Uranian system |journal=Icarus|year=1998|volume=132 |pages=266284|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998Icar..132..266B|doi=10.1006/icar.1998.5894}}</ref> They show no identifiable [[spectrum analysis|spectral features]]. The [[chemical composition]] of the ring particles is not known. However, they cannot be made of pure water ice like the [[rings of Saturn]] because they are too dark, darker than the [[moons of Uranus|inner moons of Uranus]]. This shows that they are probably a mixture of the ice and a dark material.  The nature of this material is not clear, but it may be [[organic compound]]s considerably darkened by the [[charged particle]] irradiation from the Uranian [[magnetosphere]]. The rings' particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially similar to that of the inner moons.<ref name=Baines1998/>[[File:Uranusandrings.jpg|thumb|A 1998 false-colour near-[[infrared]] image of Uranus showing [[cloud]] bands, [[planetary ring|rings]], and [[Natural satellite|moons]] obtained by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer|NICMOS camera]]]]  As a whole, the ring system of Uranus is unlike either the faint dusty [[rings of Jupiter]] or the broad and complex [[rings of Saturn]], some of which are composed of very bright materialwater ice. However, there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system; the Saturnian F ring and the  ring are both narrow, relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons. The newly discovered outer rings of Uranus are similar to the outer G and E rings of [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]. Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of Uranus. In addition, dust bands observed between the main rings of Uranus may be similar to the rings of Jupiter. In contrast, the [[Rings of Neptune|Neptunian ring]] system is quite similar to that of Uranus, although it is less complex, darker and contains more dust. The Neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet.  == Orbit and rotation == Uranus revolves around the Sun once every 84 Earth years. Its average distance from the Sun is roughly 3 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]]&nbsp;km (about 20 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]]). The intensity of sunlight on Uranus is about 1/400 that on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Next Stop Uranus| url=http://www.astrosociety.org/education/publications/tnl/04/04.html|year=1986|accessdate=June 9, 2007}}</ref> Its orbital elements were first calculated in 1783 by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].<ref>Forbes, George 1909. ''History of Astronomy''.</ref> With time, discrepancies began to appear between the predicted and observed orbits, and in 1841, [[John Couch Adams]] first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet. In 1845, [[Urbain Le Verrier]] began his own independent research into Uranus's orbit. On September 23, 1846, [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] found a new planet, later called [[Neptune]], at nearly the position predicted by Le Verrier.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mathematical discovery of planets|author=O'Connor J.J. and Robertson E.F.|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Neptune_and_Pluto.html|year=1996|accessdate=June 13, 2007}}</ref>  The rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17&nbsp;hours, 14&nbsp;minutes, clockwise ([[retrograde motion|retrograde]]). As on all [[giant planet]]s, its upper atmosphere experiences very strong winds in the direction of rotation. At some latitudes, such as about two-thirds of the way from the equator to the south pole, visible features of the atmosphere move much faster, making a full rotation in as little as 14 hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=Uranus|work=NASA World Book|author=Peter J.
