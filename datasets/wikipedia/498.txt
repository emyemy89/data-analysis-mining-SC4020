It is the nationalist government of China since its settlement in 1949. It is called the  '''[[Republic of China]] (ROC)''' (also called ''Taiwan'') which is a special region comprising the island of Taiwan and nearby islands ([[Pescadores]] islands and parts of [[Fujian]]). The ROC government led by Chinese Nationalist ([[Kuomintang]] abbreviated as KMT) moved to Taiwan after the Communist army took over the capital of Beijing. Currently, the ROC government governs [[Taipei]], the capital of Taiwan. Taiwan is southeast of the [[People's Republic of China]]'s mainland, south of [[Japan]], and north of the [[Philippines]].  Taiwan has also been called '''Formosa''', a Portuguese name which means "beautiful" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].  The largest cities in Taiwan are the [[Capital (city)|capital]], [[Taipei]], and the port city of [[Kaohsiung]].  Most people living in Taiwan (sometimes called Taiwanese) are [[Han]]. Taiwan has three large Han groups. They speak different [[dialect]]s of Chinese and their ancestors came from different places: the Southern Fujianese (from China's [[Fujian|Fujian Province]]), the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] (from China), and Mainlanders (from [[Mainland China]] after 1948).  There are also [[Taiwanese Aborigines]] who have lived in Taiwan before the Han came to live there.  == History == {{unsourced section|date=January 2021}} * In 1517, A discovery ship of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] saw this island and names it "Ilha Formosa", or "Beautiful Island" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].  * 17th century: From 1624 until 1661 [[Dutch (people)|Dutch]] colonize the southern part of Formosa and established a colonial administration in [[Fort Zeelandia]], and the [[Spain|Spanish]] colonize the north and established a colonial administration in Fuerte Santo Domingo or [[Fort Santo Domingo]].  The Dutch eventually defeated the [[Spaniard]]s and took full control of Formosa. A Chinese general named [[Koxinga]], defeated the Dutch at the [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]]. * 1860: Taiwan becomes a [[treaty port]] following the [[Treaty of Tientsin]], opening the island to contact with the world. * 1874: [[Japan]] invaded southern Taiwan, seemingly to "punish" the aborigines there for the murder of ship-wrecked Okinawan fishermen in 1871, but actually to establish a colony. Japanese forces withdraw later in the year after the [[Meiji]] and [[Qing]] empires nearly went to war. * 1884-1885: Taiwan is blockaded by French navy during the [[Sino-Franco]] War. * 1895: Qing China lost the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and gave Taiwan to [[Japan]] permanently. * 1945: Japan lost in [[World War II]] to U.S. and gave up Taiwan permanently. * 1946: U.S. accepts millions refugees and soldiers from China to Taiwan and U.S. President installs [[The Republic of China]] to govern Taiwan and to fight China and [[communism]].   * 1947: Taiwanese widely protest [[government]]al [[corruption]] under the Nationalists. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] sends in the army to restore order, killing tens of thousands. Some Taiwanese began the [[Taiwan independence movement]]. * 1949: ** [[Chinese Civil War]] between the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party and the [[Communist Party of China]] (CCP). ** The Nationalists (KMT) lose the war, and escape to the island of Taiwan. They set up [[Taipei]] as the temporary capital of Republic of China (ROC). ** The Communist Party of China (CCP) establishes Beijing as the capital of The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC).   * 1951: Japan signs the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] (1951) with U.S. * 1979: The KMT government jails many [[democracy]] activists who opposed it ([[Kaohsiung Incident]]). * 1986: The [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) is formed; it is the first party to form in the ROC other than the KMT. It remains illegal for the first year, but the KMT government does not try to ban it. * 1987: The KMT government lifts the [[martial law]] after almost 40 years. * 1988: [[Lee Teng-hui]] (KMT) became [[President of the Republic of China|president]] after [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] is dead. * 1995: Lee Teng-hui (KMT) became the first president elected by people.  * 2000: [[Li Shui-bian]] (DPP) became president. * 2000: [[Chen Shui-bian]] (DPP) became president. * 2004: Chen Shui-bian is re-elected after a controversial assassination attempt, in which many KMT-supporters believed, was staged by Chen. However, after unwillingness to cooperate about his medical records the investigation was inconclusive. * 2008: Former president Chen Sui-bian and his wife are arrested for corruption and money laundering. * 2008: [[Ma Ying-jeou]] (KMT) was elected as the president of the Republic of China and thus creating a change of political parties for the second time. * 2009: Kaohsiung hosts the 2009 World Games. * 2016: [[Tsai Ing-wen]] (DPP) was elected as the first female president of Taiwan. * 2019: [[same sex marriage]] was legalized<ref>https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Taiwan%27s_legislature_first_in_Asia_to_legalize_same-sex_marriage</ref>  == Status of Taiwan == There are two [[China|Chinese]] governments in the world: The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the [[Republic of China]] (ROC). Today, in reality, the PRC government controls mainland China, and the ROC government governs Taiwan. The ROC government governed most of China mainland from 1911 to 1949, before losing control of China mainland to the PRC.  Today, people who live in Taiwan have different ideas. Although many Taiwanese think there is no freedom in China, there are still some Taiwanese who want to be united again with China. The majority of the people in Taiwan want to keep everything like it is now.  Today most countries of the world recognize the People's Republic of China as China. Even though Taiwan is not recognized by the UN as a sovereign nation,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2012/06/20-taiwan-un-winkler |title=Taiwan's UN Dilemma: To Be or Not To Be |author=Sigrid Winkler |date=June 2012 |website= |publisher=The Brookings Institution |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref> most countries still have close economic and cultural relations with Taiwan. So, both sides are not making any big changes from the political [[status quo]]. This policy was expressed in a 1992 [[Consensus]] among some leaders of both sides.  In [[March]] 2004, China's government passed a law called the Anti-[[Secession]] Law. The law requires the Chinese [[military]] to [[invade]] Taiwan immediately if they declare [[independence]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2004/12/chinas-new-anti-secession-law-escalates-tensions-in-the-taiwan-strait |title=China's New "Anti-Secession Law" Escalates Tensions in the TaiwanStrait |author=John J.
