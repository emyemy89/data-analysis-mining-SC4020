It produces a product, an object. '''Art''' is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, performing artifacts, and expressing the author's imaginative mind. The product of art is called a '''work of art''', for others to experience.<ref>Various definitions in: Wilson, Simon & Lack, Jennifer 2008. ''The Tate guide to modern art terms''. Tate Publishing.

That kind of art is sometimes called a ''[[craft]]''.  Those who make art are called [[Artist|artists]]. They hope to affect the [[Emotion|emotions]] of people who experience it. Some people find art relaxing, exciting or informative. Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner [[creativity]].  "The arts" is a much broader term. It includes [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpting]], [[photography]], [[Performing arts|performance art]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[poetry]], [[prose]] and [[theatre]].  == Types of art == [[File:Esttuas_de_Botero_em_frente_ao_Palcio_de_Cultura_(Botero's_in_front_of_Culture_Palace).jpg|link=https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Est%C3%A1tuas_de_Botero_em_frente_ao_Pal%C3%A1cio_de_Cultura_(Botero's_in_front_of_Culture_Palace).jpg|thumb|Statues made by Botero, in front of the Culture Palace in Medellin, Colomnbia]] [[File:Chicago2_(MdB).jpg|link=https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chicago2_(MdB).jpg|thumb|A scene from the Musical Chicago, performed at a theatre, in [[Brno]].]] [[File:Nude_recumbent_woman_by_Jean-Christophe_Destailleur.jpg|link=https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nude_recumbent_woman_by_Jean-Christophe_Destailleur.jpg|thumb|247x247px|Nude Recumbent Woman, is a photograph by Jean-Christophe Destailleur. It was a featured image on Commons and is also a work of art.]] Art is divided into the [[plastic arts]], where something is made, and the [[performing arts]], where something is done by humans in action. The other division is between pure arts, done for themselves, and practical arts, done for a practical purpose, but with artistic content.  * Plastic art ** Fine art is expression by making something [[Beauty|beautiful]] or appealing to the [[Emotion|emotions]] by visual means: [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]] ** Literature: [[poetry]], creative [[writing]] * Performing art ** Performing art including [[drama]] are (expression using the body: [[dance]], [[acting]], [[singing]]) ** Auditory art (expression by making [[Sound|sounds]]): [[music]], [[singing]] * Practical art ** Culinary art (expression by making [[Flavor|flavors]] and [[Taste|tastes]]): [[cooking]] ** The practical arts (expression by making things and structures: [[architecture]], [[Movie|filming]], [[fashion]], [[photography]], [[video games]])  == What "art" means == Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the [[Mind|human mind]], [[spirit]] and [[soul]].  An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the number of people who can relate to it, and how much they appreciate it. Some people also get inspired.  The first and broadest sense of "art" means "arrangement" or "to arrange." In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design.  Art may express [[emotion]].  Artists may feel a certain emotion and wish to express it by creating something that means something to them.  Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an [[audience]].  However, if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well, then the art work may become publicly successful.  == History of art == There are sculptures, [[cave painting]] and [[rock art]] dating from the [[Upper Palaeolithic|Upper Paleolithic]] era.  All of the great ancient civilizations, such as [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient India|India]], [[Ancient China|China]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Persia]] had works and styles of art. In the [[Middle Ages]], most of the art in [[Europe]] showed people from the [[Bible]] in [[Painting|paintings]], [[stained glass]] windows, and [[mosaic]] tile floors and walls.  [[Islamic]] art includes [[geometric]] patterns, Islamic [[calligraphy]], and [[architecture]]. In [[India]] and [[Tibet]], painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included [[jade]] carving, bronze, [[pottery]], [[poetry]], calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty.  In Europe, after the [[Middle Ages]], there was a "[[Renaissance]]" which means "rebirth". People rediscovered [[science]] and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] where things in the distance look smaller in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other.  In the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to [[Industrialization|Modernity]] created many new painting styles such as [[Classicism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Realism]], and [[Impressionism]]. The history of twentieth century art includes [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada|Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], and [[Minimalism]].  == Roles of art == In some [[Society|societies]], people think that art belongs to the person who made it. They think that the artist put his or her "[[talent]]" and industry into the art. In this view, the art is the [[property]] of the artist, protected by [[copyright]].  In other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its [[social capital]] into the artist and the artist's work. In this view, society is a [[collective]] that has made the art, through the artist.  === Functions of art === The [[wikt:simple:function|functions]] of art include:<ref>{{cite book|title=Culturology|last=Bagdasaryan|first=Nadejda|year=2000|ISBN=5-06-003475-5|pages=511|language=Russian|chapter=7.

What aims did he like/dislike in human activity? This usually is clearly seen in artists' works.  6) Didactic function  : What message, criticism or political change did the artist wish to achieve?  == Related pages ==  * [[Modern art]] * [[Abstract art]] * [[Painting]] * [[Sculpture]] * [[Street art]]  == References == <references />{{commonscat}}</text>
