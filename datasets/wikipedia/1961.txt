It is next to [[Republic of India|India]], [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[China]]. It is officially called the '''Islamic Republic of Pakistan'''. It has a long coastline along the [[Arabian Sea]] in the south. Pakistan has the [[List of countries by population|fifth largest population]] (207.77 million) in the world. Pakistan has a total land area of {{convert|880940|km2|abbr=on}} (including the Pakistani controlled territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan). This makes Pakistan the 34th largest country in the world. Pakistan has the seventh largest army in the world. The [[capital city|capital]] of Pakistan is [[Islamabad]]. Before 1960, it was [[Karachi]], which is now the country's largest city.  The name '''Pkistn''' means ''Land of the Pure'' in [[Persian and Urdu]].  == Name, Flag and Anthem of Pakistan == The name '''Pakistan''' (<small>English pronunciation:</small> {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Pakistan.ogg||p||k||s|t||n}} or {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Pakistan-2.ogg|p||k|i||s|t||n}}; {{lang-ur|}} &nbsp;{{IPA|[pakstan]}}) means ''[[-stan|Land of]] (the) Spiritually Pure'' in both [[Urdu]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] languages. Many [[South-central Asia]]n states and regions end with the element -''stan,'' such as ''Afghanistan,'' ''Pakistan,'' ''Balochistan,'' ''Kurdistan,'' and ''Turkistan.'' This -''stan'' is formed from the Iranian root *STA "to stand, stay," and means "place (where one stays), home, country". Iranian peoples have been the main inhabitants of the various land regions of the Ancient [[Persian Empire]]s now owned by the states for over a thousand years. The names are compounds of -''[[-stan|stan]]'' and the name of the peoples living there. Pakistan is a bit different; its name was coined on 28 January 1933 as ''{{sic|Pak|stan|hide=y}}'' by [[Choudhary Rahmat Ali]], a [[Pakistan Movement]] activist, who published it in his paper ''[[Pakistan Declaration|Now or Never]]''.<ref name="nowornever">{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/txt_rahmatali_1933.html|title=Now or never: Are we to live or perish for ever?|author=Choudhary Rahmat Ali|publisher=Columbia University|date=28 January 1933|accessdate=4 December 2007}}</ref> by using the suffix -''istan'' from ''Baloch''istan preceded by the first letters of ''P''unjab, ''A''fghania, ''K''ashmir and ''S''indh.

It can be found in the example of a Polish name for the "United States of America," ''Stany Zjednoczone Ameryki'' (literally "States United of America").   '''<big>National Anthem:</big>'''  The [[Qaum Tarna|lyrics]] of the national anthem of Pakistan was written by [[Ahmed Ghulamali Chagla]] and was adopted as the country's national anthem on 13 August 1954. The music had actually been composed nearly three years before the lyrics were written to fit the tune.   '''<big>Flag:</big>'''  The [[Flag of Pakistan|flag]] is a green field with a white crescent moon and five-rayed star at its centre, and a vertical white stripe at the hoist side. Though the green colour is mandated only as 'dark green', its official and most consistent representation is Pakistan green, which is shaded distinctively darker.  The flag was designed by Syed Amir uddin Kedwaii and was based on the original flag of the Muslim League. It was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on August 11, 1947, just days before independence. The white colour on the flag represents the minorities and the green the Muslim majority. The crescent on the flag represents progress while the five-rayed star represents light and knowledge.  == Government and politics == {{main|Government of Pakistan|Politics of Pakistan}} '''Pakistan''' has a federal [[parliamentary system]].<ref name="gop1">{{cite web|url=http://202.83.164.26/wps/portal/!ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hQN68AZ3dnIwN3C3MDAyOPYDNvXwMjQwNnI6B8pFm8n79RqJuJp6GhhZmroYGRmYeJk0-Yp4G7izEB3eEg-_DrB8kb4ACOBvp-Hvm5qfoFuREGWSaOigDeD0uL/dl2/d1/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnB3LzZfVUZKUENHQzIwT0gwODAySFMyNzZWMzEwMDE!/|title=About Government|publisher=Government of Pakistan|accessdate=5 March 2009|archive-date=24 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024003102/http://202.83.164.26/wps/portal/!ut/p/c1/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os_hQN68AZ3dnIwN3C3MDAyOPYDNvXwMjQwNnI6B8pFm8n79RqJuJp6GhhZmroYGRmYeJk0-Yp4G7izEB3eEg-_DrB8kb4ACOBvp-Hvm5qfoFuREGWSaOigDeD0uL/dl2/d1/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnB3LzZfVUZKUENHQzIwT0gwODAySFMyNzZWMzEwMDE!/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[head of state]] is an indirectly-elected ceremonial [[President of Pakistan|President]]. The [[Electoral college]] of the country, (composed of the [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]], the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]], and the four Provincial Assemblies) chooses a leadership representing the President of Pakistan for a five-year term. The president is also the [[Commander-in-Chief|Commander in Chief]] of the [[Pakistani military|Joint Armed Forces]]. The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]], who is also indirectly elected.  The President's appointment and term are constitutionally independent of the Prime Ministers term. The Prime Minister is usually the leader of the largest party in the National Assembly or of a coalition in the National Assembly.  The Prime Minister is the head of government. Pakistan's legislature is made of a 100-member Senate (upper house) and a 342-member National Assembly (lower house). The Chief Justice of Pakistan is the chief judge who oversees the judicature's court system at all levels of command.

Military dictators include [[Ayub Khan]] in the 1960s, General [[General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] in the 1980s.  Pakistan's two largest [[political party|political parties]] are the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|Pakistan People's Party]] and the government party [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]]. The [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf]] has also gained popularity in the past years.  On 27 December 2007, the leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party, [[Benazir Bhutto]], was [[assassinate]]d. The reason is yet to be determined.  === Administrative divisions === {{main|Administrative units of Pakistan|Districts of Pakistan}}  Pakistan is made up of four provinces, two territories and two special areas. Both special areas are in [[Kashmir]]. The provinces and territories are divided into 26 [[Divisions of Pakistan|divisions]] with now 147 [[Districts of Pakistan|districts]] directly divided from the provinces. Each district is divided into several [[tehsil]]s and each tehsil is divided into several union councils. There are around 596 tehsils and over 6,000 union councils in Pakistan.

After that, the Vedic period came. This also included parts of north-western [[Republic of India]]. Until 1971, Pakistan also included an area in the [[North-east India]] region. This is now called [[Bangladesh]]. It lost that area after a war with the Indian Army and the joint militant group of Indo-Bangladeshi alliance of [[Mitro Bahini]] of [[West Bengal]]. During recent times Pakistan has been in the centre of world politics. This is first because of its support to guerillas in [[Afghanistan]], following a Soviet [[invasion]] 1979, and later during the 1990s because of its cooperation with and support for the [[Taliban]] [[regime]] in [[Afghanistan]]. However, since 2000 Pakistan has supported the West in their war against fundamentalist [[terrorism]], including the removal of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.  Pakistan is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. However, after the war in East Pakistan the country was excluded (between 1972-1989). It was also a member between 1999 and 2007, it was excluded in 2007 for a time but again became a member in 2008.<ref>[http://thecommonwealth.org/news/34580/34581/179063/120508cmag.htm Commonwealth lifts ban on Pakistan]</ref>  == Geography and climate == {{main|Geography of Pakistan}} [[File:Paktopo de.jpg|thumb|left|This is a map of Pakistan and Kashmir, as it is seen from space.]] There are many earthquakes in the area.

In fact, Pakistan has the 5th largest population of Hindus, after [[Sri Lanka]].  The word ''Hindu'' comes from the [[Indus River|Sindhu]] (Indus River) of Pakistan. The Sindhu is one of the holy rivers of Hinduism. Thus, in many ways, the land which is today's heavily Muslim Pakistan has played an important part in the origin of Hinduism. There are about 3 million Hindus living in Pakistan.  === Poverty === Poverty in Pakistan is a growing concern. Although the middle-class has grown in Pakistan, nearly one-quarter of the population is classified poor as of October 2006.  == Sports == {{further|Pakistan at the Olympics|Pakistan national field hockey team|Pakistan national football team}}  The national sport of Pakistan is [[field hockey]], although [[cricket]] is the most popular game across the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/saad-khan/the-death-of-sports-in-pa_b_498758.html|title=The Death of Sports in Pakistan|last=Khan|first=Saad|date=15 March 2010|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref> The national cricket team has won the [[Cricket World Cup]] once (in 1992), were runners-up once (in 1999), and co-hosted the games twice (in 1987 and 1996). Pakistan were runners-up in the inaugural 2007 ICC World Twenty20 held in South Africa and were the champions at the 2009 ICC World [[Twenty20]] held in England. The team also won two Asia Cups in 2000 and 2012. Lately however, Pakistani cricket has suffered heavily due to teams refusing to tour Pakistan after militants attacked the touring [[2009 attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lankan team in March 2009]], after which no international cricket was played until May 2015, when the Zimbabwean team agreed to tour. However, now, with increased security, the [[Sri Lanka cricket team|Sri Lankan cricket team]] came for a tour as recently as 2019.  In addition to sports like field hockey, cricket, squash rackets, football and others, Pakistanis are also very keen on [[equestrianism]] of various types,and equestrian sports such as [[Polo]] and the traditional [[Tent pegging]] are played by many. Other traditional rural sports include two types of [[Wrestling]], [[Kabbadi]] and a martial art called [[Gatka]].  ==Related pages== * [[Religions of Pakistan]] * [[List of rivers of Pakistan]] * [[Political families of Pakistan]] * [[Transportation in Pakistan]]  == References == {{reflist|2}} '''Notes''' {{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}  {{Asia}} {{Commonwealth nations}} {{Middle East}} {{authority control}} [[Category:Pakistan| ]] [[Category:Flag and National Anthem]] [[Category:1947 establishments in Asia]] [[Category:British India]] [[Category:English-speaking countries]] [[Category:Federations]] [[Category:Members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] __FORCETOC__ __NEWSECTIONLINK__</text>
