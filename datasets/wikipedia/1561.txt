<title>Coal</title><text>[[File:Coal bituminous.jpg|thumb|200px|A piece of bituminous coal]] [[File:Coal anthracite.jpg|thumb|200px|A piece of high-quality anthracite coal]]  '''Coal''' is a hard [[Rock (geology)|rock]] which can be burned as a [[solid]] [[fossil fuel]]. It is mostly [[carbon]] but also contains [[hydrogen]], [[sulphur]], [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]. It is a [[sedimentary rock]] formed from [[peat]], by the pressure of rocks laid down later on top.    [[Peat]], and therefore coal, is formed from the remains of [[plant]]s which lived millions of years ago in [[tropical]] [[wetland]]s  ([[coal swamps]]), such as those of the late [[Carboniferous]] period (the [[Pennsylvanian]]). Also wood heated in an airless space can make [[charcoal]], which is like coal.  Coal can be burned for [[energy]] or [[heat]]. About two-thirds of the coal [[Coal mining|mined]] today is burned in [[power station]]s to make [[electricity]]. Like [[petroleum|oil]], when coal is burned its carbon joins with oxygen in the air and makes a lot of [[carbon dioxide]], which causes [[climate change]]. Because of that and other [[air pollution]] from coal most countries are turning to new sources of energy, such as [[solar power]]. But new [[coal power]] plants are still being built in some parts of the world, such as China.   Coal can be roasted (heated very hot in a place where there is no [[oxygen]]) to produce [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]. Coke can be used in [[metallurgy|smelting]] to [[reduction (chemistry)|reduce]] metals from their [[ore]]s.  == History == [[File:British.coalfields.19th.century.jpg|thumb|right|150px|British coalfields in the nineteenth century.]] Coal was the most important fuel of the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/clips/zgtk2hv</ref> Coal was an important part of rail freight in the UK in the 20th century, forming the greater part of several companies' freight volume.  Early in the 21st century most coal fired power stations in the [[United Kingdom]] and several other countries were closed to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.  == Different kinds of coal and how they form == [[Image:Sydney Mines Point Aconi Seam 038.JPG|thumb|230px|Layer of bituminous coal at the seaside in [[Nova Scotia]]]]  Under suitable conditions, plant material is transformed step by step into # [[Peat]] is not yet coal. # '''Lignite''' (brown coal) is the dirtiest coal, is about 60%-70% carbon, and is used as fuel for electric power generation. [[Jet (lignite)|Jet]] is a compact form of lignite that is sometimes polished and has long been used as an ornamental stone. # '''Sub-bituminous coal''' is used as fuel for steam-electric power generation. Also, it is a source of light [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s for the [[chemical synthesis]] industry. # '''Bituminous coal''' is a dense rock, black but sometimes dark brown. It is a relatively soft coal that breaks and burns readily and quickly.  It used as fuel in power stations, and for heat and power applications in manufacturing, for [[blacksmith]]ing; and to make [[coke (fuel)|coke]]. # '''Steam coal''' was once widely used as a fuel for [[steam locomotive]]s.  In this specialized use it is sometimes known as ''sea-coal'' in the U.S.<ref>Funk and Wagnalls, quoted in {{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=2nd ed, Oxford University Press |year=1989 |chapter=sea-coal}}</ref> Small steam coal (''dry small steam nuts'' or DSSN) was used as a fuel for domestic [[water heating]]. # '''Anthracite''' is a harder, glossy, black coal.  It is longer burning, and used mainly for residential and commercial space heating.  # [[Graphite]] is difficult to burn and is not so commonly used as fuel. It is still used in [[pencils]], mixed with clay.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeremy Norman|chapter=Invention of Modern Pencil Lead|chapter-url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=1588|title=From Cave Paintings to the Internet|publisher=Jeremy Norman & Co.}}</ref> When powdered, it can be used as a [[lubricant]].  [[Diamond]] is commonly believed to be the end result of this process, but this is not true. Diamond is carbon but is not formed from coal.   Coal contains impurities. The particular impurities determine the use. Coking coal has little ash or sulfur or [[phosphorus]]. Those would spoil the iron made by the [[blast furnace]].  == Environmental problems == [[File:Air pollution from Ladyzyn thermal power plant.jpg|thumb|right|Burning coal produces large amounts of air pollution]] Coal, when burnt, gives off almost a third more [[carbon dioxide]] per unit of energy than oil, and 80% more than [[natural gas]]. Almost half of the carbon dioxide from people is because of burning coal so it is the biggest single cause of global warming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://endcoal.org/climate-change/|title=End Coal - Climate Change|website=End Coal}}</ref> Coal contributes to [[acid rain]] and [[smog]], especially when burned without [[scrubber]]s. Burning coal releases toxic chemicals, including [[soot]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[carbon monoxide]], which contribute to diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[asthma]] in both humans and wild animals. Coal mining, especially mountaintop removal mining, can damage large areas of land and destroy natural [[habitat]]s. Higher grades of coal burn more cleanly than lower grades, although they still pollute more than other fuels. In addition to air pollution, burning coal produces toxic coal ash, which can cause [[water pollution]] if it is accidentally released into the environment. There are several underground mine fires burning throughout the world. These underground fires release toxic smoke into the air, and can also cause the ground above to collapse. The city of Centralia, Pennsylvania was evacuated and is now abandoned due to an underground coal mine fire.  === Deaths and illness from pollution === It is difficult to give exact figures for the effects of coal on health. It is claimed that because of coal every year over 800,000 people die early and millions of people get ill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://endcoal.org/health/|title=End Coal - Health|website=End Coal}}</ref> Coal miners often get [[pneumoconiosis]] (black lung disease) from exposure to coal dust.  ==Protests against coal== [[File:Coral not coal protest at India Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Visit to Australia (25563929593).jpg|right|thumb|Protesting damage to the [[Great Barrier Reef]] caused by climate change in Australia]] [[File:Gemeinsam stark,Hambacher Forst,NRW.jpg|right|thumb|Tree houses for protesting the cutting down of part of Hambach Forest for the Hambach surface mine in Germany: after which the felling was suspended in 2018]] Opposition to coal pollution was one of the main reasons the modern environmental movement started in the 19th century.  == Peak coal == [[File:World_Coal_Consumption.png|thumb|World Coal Consumption]] Peak coal means the year in which most coal is mined or burned. Many countries have already passed their peak coal years, for example [[Germany]] in 1985 and the [[United States]] in 2008. Now those countries are mining and burning less coal. But [[China]] still mines a lot of coal and is helping a few countries, like [[Pakistan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/5cd07544-7960-11e8-af48-190d103e32a4|title=Pakistans pivot to coal to boost energy gets critics fired up|first=Kiran|last=Stacey|date=31 July 2018|website=Financial Times}}</ref> mine more coal and build more coal-fired power stations.

This legend comes from [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times when it was common to burn coal in the fireplace, rather than wood. Children who did not receive toys would at least get coal to stay warm.  == Related pages == {{commons category|Coal}} * [[Coal mining]] * [[Coal forests]]  == References == {{Reflist}}  == Other websites == * [https://www.electricitymap.org Electricity Map] countries where more coal is burned are usually darker brown on map * [https://www.ncm.org.uk/ National Coal Mining Museum for England]   [[Category:Basic English 850 words]] [[Category:Fossil fuels]] [[Category:Sedimentary rocks]] [[Category:Environmental issues]] [[Category:Hydrocarbons]]</text>
