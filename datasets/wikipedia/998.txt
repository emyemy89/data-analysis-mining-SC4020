The best-known type of football is [[association football]]. This is called "[[soccer]]" in [[North America]], [[South Africa]], and [[Australia]] to avoid confusion with other types of football that are commonly played there.  The name ''football'' comes from the two words '[[wikt:foot|foot]]' and '[[wikt:ball|ball]]'. It is named football because the players of the game [[walking|walk]] and often [[running|run]] (on their [[foot|feet]]) while playing, as opposed to (for example) [[polo]] where the players ride horses. Football is played using a ball, also called a 'football', that is usually shaped like a [[sphere]] or an [[ellipsoid]]. The ball is often kicked with the foot, but depending on the game, it can also be hit using other parts of the body (in association football) and handling the ball is a part of some other sports known as 'football'.  Some elements of football have been seen in many countries, dating back to the second and third century [[AD]] in [[China]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=History of Football|url=http://www.history.co.uk/study-topics/history-of-football-tennis/history-of-football|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923204057/http://www.history.co.uk/study-topics/history-of-football-tennis/history-of-football|archive-date=September 23, 2013|accessdate=2015-05-11|website=|publisher=AETN UK}}</ref> The modern games of both [[rugby football]] and association football comes from [[19th century|19th-century]] [[England]].<ref>Green, Geoffrey (953; ''The history of the Football Association''.

Today, it is the most popular sport in the world and many people watch it on [[television]], especially the [[FIFA World Cup]] that happens every four years.  Every year there is a Football Club Competition called as Champions League. All the qualified big teams take part. At the end, we have one winner who takes the prestigious UEFA trophy. All big players play for their own teams. Some big players who take part every year are Mbappe, Ronaldo, Messi, Dybala, Neymar and many more  <br />  == Types of football == [[File:Warrior Games athletes honored at Navy-Air Force football game 141004-D-DB155-022.jpg|260px|thumb|left|A game of American (gridiron) football.
