<title>Mixture</title><text>In [[chemistry]], a '''mixture''' is a substance that is made up of two or more simpler [[substance]]<nowiki/>s. These substances can be [[chemical element]]s or [[Chemical compound|compounds]]. A mixture can be made of [[liquid]]s, [[solid]]s, or [[gas]]es.  A mixture is not the same as a [[Chemical compound|compound]] which is made of two or more [[atom]]s connected together. For instance, a mixture of the gases [[hydrogen]] and [[nitrogen]] contains hydrogen and nitrogen, not the compound [[ammonia]] which is made of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms.  A mixture where the different parts can be distinguished easily is called ''heterogenous'', one where this is not the case is called ''homogeneous''. A third form is called [[colloid]].  If one substance in a mixture [[dissolution|dissolves]] in the other, it is called a [[solution]]. For example, if [[sugar]] is put in water it forms a mixture, then dissolves to make a solution. If it does not dissolve, it would be called a [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]].  Solids can be mixtures also. [[Alloy]]<nowiki/>s are mixtures. Many kinds of [[soil]] and [[mineral|rock]] are mixtures of different [[mineral]]s. Thus, a mixture is made of two or more elements and/or compounds which are not chemically combined.  ==Gallery== <gallery> File:Red Wine Glass.jpg|Red [[wine]] in a glass, a homogeneous mixture.
