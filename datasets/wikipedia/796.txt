Many [[country|countries]] have named their money ''the dollar'', so it is important to say which dollar is being talked about. The symbol for the dollar is a capital letter S, pierced by one or two vertical lines: '''$'''.  == History == The dollar is named after the [[thaler]]. The thaler was a large silver coin first made in the year [[1518]]. The thaler named after the [[Joachimsthal]] (Joachim's valley) mine in [[Bohemia]] (''Thal'' means [[valley]] in [[German language|German]]). The later Spanish Peso was the same size and was often called "[[Spanish dollar]]" and the similar coin of the [[Dutch Republic]] was called lion dollar. In the 18th century it became a world currency. Many national currencies were originally Spanish dollars including the ones now called dollar or [[peso]] and the [[Japanese yen]], [[Indian rupee]] and Chinese [[Renminbi]].  ==List of dollars== *[[Australian dollar]] *[[Bahamian dollar]] *[[Barbadian dollar]] *[[Belize dollar]] *[[Canadian dollar]] *[[East Caribbean dollar]] *[[:en:Hong_Kong_dollar|Hong Kong dollar]] * [[Namibian dollar]] *[[New Zealand Dollar|New Zealand dollar]] *[[Singapore dollar]] *[[United States dollar]] *[[Zimbabwean dollar]] {{stub}}  [[Category:Currency]]</text>
