Its inhabitants are all the people and [[animal]]s that live on it. Its phenomena are the things that happen like [[tide]]s, [[wind]]s, and [[earthquake]]s.  A person who is an expert in geography is a geographer. A geographer tries to understand the world and the things that are in it, how they started and how they have changed.<ref>Geography: The Mother of Sciences [http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf] [https://web.archive.org/web/20081003084542/http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf] </ref>  Geography is divided into two main parts called [[physical geography]] and [[human geography]]. Physical geography studies the natural environment and human geography studies the human environment. The human environmental studies would include things such as the [[population]] in a country, how a country's [[economy]] is doing, and more. There is also environmental geography.  [[Map]]s are a main tool of geography, so geographers spend much time making and studying them. Making maps is called [[cartography]], and people who specialize in making maps are cartographers.  == Branches ==  === Physical geography === {{Main|Physical geography}} Physical geography (or physiography) focuses on geography as an [[Earth science]]. It aims to understand the physical problems and the issues of [[lithosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[pedosphere]], and global [[flora]] and [[fauna]] patterns ([[biosphere]]).   <center> '''Physical geography can be divided into many broad categories, including:'''  :{| style="border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin: auto;" cellspacing="15" | [[File:Lnea de Wallace.jpg|96px]] || [[File:Cyclone Catarina from the ISS on March 26 2004.JPG|96px]] || [[File:90 mile beach.jpg|96px]] || [[File:Gavin Plant.JPG|96px]] |- | [[Biogeography]] || [[Climatology]] & [[Meteorology]] || [[Coastal geography]] || [[Environmental management]] |- | [[File:Meridian convergence and spehrical excess.png|96px]] || [[File:Delicate Arch LaSalle.jpg|96px]] || [[File:Receding glacier-en.svg|96px]] ||[[File:Meander.svg|96px]] |- | [[Geodesy]] || [[Geomorphology]] || [[Glaciology]] || [[Hydrology]] & [[Hydrography]] |- | [[File:Khajuraho-landscape.jpg|96px]] || [[File:World11.jpg|96px]] || [[File:Soil profile.jpg|96px]] || [[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|96px]] |- | [[Landscape ecology]] || [[Oceanography]] || [[Pedology (soil study)|Pedology]] || [[Palaeogeography]] |- | [[File:Milankovitch Variations sv.png|96px]] |- | [[Quaternary science]] |} </center>  === Human geography === [[File:Menschentraube.jpg|thumb|220px|A crowd of people around a band.]] '''[[Human geography]]''' is the [[Social sciences|social science]] that covers the study of people and their communities, cultures, economies and their interaction with the environment.
