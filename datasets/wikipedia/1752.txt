He led the first [[expedition]] to reach the [[South Pole]] and the first that could prove it made it to the [[North Pole]]. Amundsen was also the first man known to travel the [[Northwest Passage]].  ==Life== When Amundsen was young, he decided he would use his life to explore the wilderness. He was inspired by the lives of [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and [[John Franklin]].<ref name="Life">{{cite book | title=My Life as an Explorer | publisher=Doubleday, Page & company | author=Amundsen, Roald | year=1927 | location=Garden City, NY}}</ref> While his mother was alive he did not go to sea, to keep a promise to her.

This was the first expedition to stay over winter at Antartica, since their ship got stuck in the ice preventing them from leaving.    In 1903, Amundsen led the first expedition to make it through the [[Northwest Passage]].<ref name="explore">{{cite book|title=''Roald Amundsen and the Exploration of the Northwest Passage''|publisher=Fram Museum|location=Oslo|year=2008|isbn=9788282350013|pages=6365}}</ref>  In October 1911, he began his expedition to Antarctica with four other men in attempt to be the first man to reach the South Pole.<ref>{{cite book |last=Huntford |first=Roland |year=1985 |title=The Last Place on Earth |url=https://archive.org/details/lastplaceonearth0000hunt |publisher=Pan Books |location=London and Sydney |isbn=0-330-28816-4}}</ref>  [[Robert Falcon Scott]], an explorer from Britain, arrived in Antarctica with his own team only days after Amundsen. Both explorers raced to the South Pole, but Amundsen and his men used [[ski]]s and [[dog]] [[sled]]s for transportation. This was more efficient. On 14 December 1911, Amundsen successfully became the first man to reach the South Pole.<ref>{{cite book |last=Amundsen |first=Roald |author2 = Nilsen, Thorvald |author3=Prestrud, Kristian |translator=Chater, A.G. |year=1976 |origyear=1912 |title=The South Pole: An Account of the Norwegian expedition in the ''Fram'', 191012 ''(Volumes I and II)'' |publisher=C.
