<title>Philosophy</title><text>{{About|philosophy as a proper field of study|text=It is not about 'personal philosophy' or other kinds of [[pseudo-philosophy]].}} [[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Socrates, a Riyemz copy from a Greek [[statue]], [[Louvre]] museum]]  '''Philosophy''' is the [[study (field)|study]] of [[wikt:underlie|underlying]] things. This means philosophy tries to understand the reasons or [[wikt:|basis]] for things. It also tries to understand how things should be. "{{lang|grc|Philosophia}}" is the [[Ancient Greek]] word for the "love of [[wisdom]]".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Philosophy|encyclopedia=Encyclopdia Britannica|date=August 20, 2020|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophy }}</ref> A person who does philosophy is called a '''philosopher'''. A philosopher is a kind of [[intellectual|thinker]] or [[researcher]]. A "philosophy" can also mean a group of ideas by philosophers, or by a philosopher.<ref name=MerriamWebster>{{cite dictionary|title=Philosophy|dictionary=Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster|access-date=November 21, 2020|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/philosophy }}</ref> Philosophy is a way of thinking about the [[world]], the [[universe]], and [[society]]. In the past, [[science]]s were part of philosophy as well.  The ideas in philosophy are often general and ''[[wikt:abstract|abstract]]''. But this does not mean that philosophy is not about the real world. [[Ethics]], for example, asks about how to be [[good]] in our day-to-day lives. [[Metaphysics]] asks about how the world works and what it is made of. Sometimes people talk about how they have a personal philosophy, which means the way a person thinks about the world. This article is ''not'' about people's personal philosophies. This article is about the ideas that have been discussed by [[philosopher]]s (people who think and write about ways of thinking) for a long time.  One philosophical question is this: "Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it?".<ref>[[Bertrand Russell|Russell, Bertrand]] 1912. ''The problems of philosophy''. Home University Library.</ref> Other questions asked by philosophers are these:  * What happens to a soul after death, how does a soul enter into the body before death? *Why are we born? *Why should we live? *Why are there so many hurdles in life? *How do we overcome suffering? *What is the importance of the material life? *Will the universe exist forever? * What is [[beauty]]? * Do we have [[free will]]? * Does [[God]] exist? * Does the [[world]] around us [[existence|exist]]? * What is [[truth]]?  * What is [[evil]]? * What is the [[relationship]] between [[mind]] and [[body]]?  == History == The [[Etymology|etymological]] meaning of the word 'Philosophy' is 'love of wisdom'. It comes from the Greek word ''<nowiki/>'Philosophia'<nowiki/>'', with ''<nowiki/>'Philo'<nowiki/>'' meaning ''<nowiki/>'beloved'<nowiki/>'' and ''<nowiki/>'Sophia''<nowiki/>' meaning ''<nowiki/>'wisdom'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english-ingles.com/etymology-of-philosophy/|title=Etymology of Philosophy|website=english-ingles.com|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref>  There are different types of philosophy from different times and places. Some philosophers came from [[Ancient Greece]], such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. Others came from Asia, such as [[Confucius]] or [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [https://www.iep.utm.edu/laozi/ Laozi]. Some philosophers are from the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, such as [[William of Ockham]] or [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]].  Philosophers from the 1600s, 1700s, and 1800s included [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Ren Descartes]], [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Philosophers from the 1900s included [[Sren Kierkegaard]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].  == Areas of inquiry == '''Philosophy''' is the study of [[human]]s and the [[world]] by thinking and asking questions. It is a science and an [[art]]. Philosophy tries to answer important questions by coming up with answers about real things and asking "why?"  Sometimes, philosophy tries to answer the same questions as [[religion]] and [[science]]. Philosophers do not all give the same answers to a question. Many types of philosophy criticize or even attack the beliefs of science and religion.  In his work ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',  [[Immanuel Kant]] asked the following questions:<ref>Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, II 2 2</ref> #What can I say?  #What shall I do? #What dare I hope? #What is man? The answers to these questions gives the different domains or categories of philosophy.  === Categories in philosophy === Philosophy can be divided into different groups, based on the types of questions that it asks. Below is a list of questions split into groups. One possible list of answers to these questions can be called a 'philosophy'. There are many different 'philosophies', because all of these questions have many different answers according to different people. Not all philosophies ask the same questions. These are the questions that are usually asked by philosophers from the [[Western world]]:  '''[[Metaphysics]]''':  Metaphysics is sometimes split up into [[ontology]] (the philosophy of real life and living things), the [[philosophy of mind]] and the [[philosophy of religion]]; but these sub-branches are very close together.  ''Ontology'': * What is the world that we see around us? (What is [[reality]]?) ** Is there more to the world than just what we see or hear?  ** If nobody sees something happening, does that mean that it did not happen? ** What does it mean to say that something is possible? Do other worlds exist? * Is there anything very special about being a [[human being]] or being [[life|alive]] at all? ** If not, why do some people think that there is? * What is [[Space (physics)|space]]? What is [[time]]?  ''The philosophy of mind'': * What is a [[mind]]? * What is a [[body]]? * What is [[consciousness]]? * Do people make choices, or can they only choose to do one thing? (Do people have [[free will]]?) * What makes words or ideas meaningful? (What is the relation between meaningful words or ideas and the things that they mean?)  ''The philosophy of religion'': * Do people have [[soul]]s? * Is there a [[God]] who created the Universe?  '''In [[epistemology]]''':  * What is [[knowledge]]?  * How can we know anything? * What is [[science]]? * What is [[truth]]?  '''In [[ethics]]''': * What are right and wrong, good and bad? * Should people do some things and not others? * What is [[:wikt:justice|justice]]?  '''In [[aesthetics]]''': * What is [[beauty]]? What if one person thinks a painting is beautiful, but another person thinks the painting is ugly? Can the painting be beautiful and ugly at the same time? * Are [[truth|true]] things beautiful? * Are [[goodness|good]] things beautiful? * What is [[art]]? We commonly think that a [[sculpture]] in a [[museum]] is art. If a sculptor sculpts a sculpture of a rock from clay, and puts it in a museum, many would call it art. But what if a person picks up a rock from the ground - is the rock a piece of art?  '''In [[logic]]''': * What do the words we use mean? * How can we say things (especially [[idea]]s) in a way that only has one meaning? * Can all ideas be expressed using [[language]]? * How does the [[truth]] of an [[argument]]'s [[premise]] affect the truth of its conclusion? * How can we reason correctly?  '''In [[:en:Axiology|axiology]]''': * What has value? * Is time really money? or have we made it so? * Does love, beauty, or justice hold any value?  Other divisions include [[eschatology]], [[teleology]] and [[theology]]. In past centuries natural [[science]] was included in philosophy, and called "natural philosophy".  == Is philosophy good or bad? == Does philosophy do any good? Very few people would dispute this. It is easy to argue that philosophy is a good thing, because it helps people to think more clearly. Philosophy helps people to understand the world and the way people act and think. Philosophers believe that asking philosophical questions is useful because it brings [[wisdom]] and helps people to learn about the world and each other. Some philosophers might even argue that the question "Is philosophy good or bad?" is a philosophical question itself.  However, some people think that philosophy is harmful, as philosophy encourages free-thinking and often questions the beliefs that others hold. For example, philosophies such as some [[existentialist]] views say that there is no meaning to life or human existence, except the meaning that we make up or invent. People from some religions do not agree with the beliefs of existentialism.  Every major science, including physics, biology, and chemistry, are disciplines that were once considered as philosophy. Medicine was always considered a practical art, however. As facts about nature became more understood, these subjects branched away. Psychology only split a century and a half ago. In our own time, subjects such as consciousness studies, decision theory, and applied ethics have increasingly found independence from philosophy as a whole. Because of this, philosophy seems useful because it spins off new kinds of science.  == What philosophers do == Philosophers ask questions about ideas ([[concepts]]). They try to find answers to those questions. Some thinkers find it very hard to find those words that best describe the ideas they have. When they find answers to some of these questions philosophers often have the same problem, that is how to best tell the answers they found to other people. Depending on the meaning of the words they use, the answers change.  Some philosophers are full-time thinkers (called academics), who work for universities or colleges. These philosophers write books and articles about philosophy and teach classes about philosophy to university or college students.  Other philosophers are just "[[hobby]]" thinkers who think about philosophy during their free time. A small number of hobby thinkers have thought so much about philosophy that they are able to write articles for philosophy magazines. Other people approach philosophy from another job. For example, [[monk]]s, [[artist]]s, and [[scientist]]s may think about philosophical ideas and questions.  Most philosophers work by asking questions and looking for good definitions (meanings) of words to help them understand what a question means.  Some philosophers say the only thing needed to answer a question is to find out what it means. The only thing that makes philosophical questions (such as those above) difficult is that people do not really know what they mean. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] believed this.  Philosophers often use both real and imaginary examples to make a point. For example, they may write about a real or fictional person in order to show what they think a good person or a bad person is like.  Some philosophers look for the simplest way to answer a question and say that is probably the right answer. This is a process called [[Occam's razor]]. Others believe that complicated answers to questions can also be right. For an example of a philosophical problem, see the [[God paradox]].  Philosophers use [[logic]] to solve problems and answer questions. Logical [[consistency]] is a cornerstone of any acceptable theory. Philosophers who disagree with a theory will often try to find a logical [[contradiction]] in a theory. If they find a contradiction, this gives them a reason to reject that theory. If they do not find an inconsistency, the philosopher might show that the theory leads to a conclusion which is either unacceptable or ridiculous. This second approach is usually called [[reductio ad absurdum]].  == Some philosophers == People listed here should be genuine philosophers, rather than social or political campaigners.
