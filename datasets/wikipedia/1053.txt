Counterclockwise from top: [[second]] ([[time]]), [[metre]] ([[length]]), [[ampere]] ([[electric current]]), [[kelvin]] ([[temperature]]), [[candela]] ([[luminous intensity]]), [[Mole (unit)|mole]] ([[amount of substance]]) and [[kilogram]] ([[mass]]). ]] The '''International System of Units''' is the standard modern form of the [[metric system]]. The name of this system can be shortened or [[abbreviation|abbreviated]] to '''SI''', from the [[French language|French]] name '''''S'''ystme '''I'''nternational d'units''.  The International System of Units is a [[system of measurement]] based on 7 base units: the [[metre]] (length), [[kilogram]] (mass), [[second]] (time), [[ampere]] (electric current), [[Kelvin]] (temperature), [[mole (unit)|mole]] (quantity), and [[candela]] (brightness). These base units can be used in combination with each other. This creates ''SI derived units'', which can be used to describe other quantities, such as [[volume]], [[energy]], [[pressure]], and [[velocity]].  The system is used almost globally. Only [[Myanmar]], [[Liberia]], and the [[United States]] do not use SI as their official system of measurement.<ref name="ciawf">{{cite web |title=Appendix G: Weights and Measures |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-g.html |work=The World Facebook |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |date=2013 |accessdate=5 April 2013}}</ref> In these countries, though, SI is commonly used in science and medicine.  == History and use == The [[metric system]] was created in [[France]] after the [[French Revolution]] in [[1789]]. The original system only had two standard units, the kilogram and the metre. The metric system became popular amongst scientists.  In the [[1860s]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[William Thomson]] (later known as Lord Kelvin) suggested a system with three base units - length, mass, and time. Other units would be derived from those three base units. Later, this suggestion would be used to create the [[centimetre-gram-second system of units]] (CGS), which used the [[centimetre]] as the base unit for length, the [[gram]] as the base unit for mass, and the second as the base unit for time. It also added the [[dyne]] as the base unit for [[force]] and the [[erg]] as the base unit for energy.  As scientists studied [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], they realized other base units were needed to describe these subjects. By the middle of the [[20th century]], many different versions of the metric system were being used. This was very confusing.  In [[1954]], the 9th [[CGPM|General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) created the first version of the International System of Units. The six base units that they used were the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, Kelvin, and candela.<!-- how do you cite these things properly help --><ref name="9cgpm">{{citation |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/10/6/ |author= [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] |title=Systme pratique d'units de mesure (Practical system of units) |year=1954}}. 9<sup>th</sup> session, Resolution 6.</ref> The seventh base unit, the mole, was added in [[1971]].<ref name="14cgpm">{{citation |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/14/3/ |author= International Bureau of Weights and Measures |title=Unit SI de quantit de matire (SI unit of amount of substance) |year=1971}}. 14<sup>th</sup> session, Resolution 3.</ref>  SI is now used almost everywhere in the world, except in the [[United States]], [[Liberia]] and [[Myanmar]], where the older [[imperial unit]]s are still widely used. Other countries, most of them historically related to the [[British Empire]], are slowly replacing the old imperial system with the metric system or using both systems at the same time.  == Units of measurement ==  === Base units ===  The SI '''base units''' are [[measurement]]s used by scientists and other people around the world. All the other units can be written by combining these seven base units in different ways. These other units are called "derived units".  :{| class="wikitable floatleft" style="margin:1em auto 1em auto" |+ <big>SI base units</big><ref name="NIST330">{{cite book |author-first1=Barry N. |author-last1=Taylor |author-first2=Ambler |author-last2=Thompson |title=The International System of Units (SI) (Special publication 330) |url=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2016/12/07/sp330.pdf |access-date=2017-08-04 |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |location=Gaithersburg, MD |date=2008}}</ref>{{rp|23}}<ref name="BIPM1975"> [http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/author/mills.html Quantities Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry], IUPAC</ref><ref>{{cite book| last1 = Page| first1 = Chester Hall| last2 = Vigoureux| first2 = Paul| title = The International Bureau of Weights and Measures 18751975: NBS Special Publication 420| url = https://books.google.com/?id=nOG0SxxEu64C&pg=PA240| date = 1975-05-20| publisher = [[National Bureau of Standards]]| location = [[Washington, D.C.]]| pages = 238244| editor-first1 = Chester H.| editor-first2 = Paul| editor-last1 = Page| editor-last2 = Vigoureux }}</ref> |- !Unit<br />name !Unit<br />symbol ![[Dimensional analysis|Dimension<br />symbol]] ![[Physical quantity|Quantity<br />name]] !Definition<ref group="n">Interim definitions are given here only when there has been a ''significant'' difference in the definition.</ref> |- ![[second]] |style="text-align:center" |s |style="text-align:center" |T |[[time]] | * '''Prior''': <math>\frac{1}{86400}</math> of a day of 24&nbsp;hours of 60&nbsp;minutes of 60&nbsp;seconds * '''Interim''' (1956): <math>\frac{1}{31556925.9747}</math> of the [[tropical year]] for 1900 January 0 at 12&nbsp;hours [[ephemeris time]]. * '''Current''' (1967): The duration of {{val|9192631770}} periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two [[Hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] levels of the [[ground state]] of the [[caesium-133]] atom. |- ![[metre]] |style="text-align:center" |m |style="text-align:center" |L |[[length]] | * '''Prior''' (1793): <math>\frac{1}{10000000}</math> of the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] through Paris between the North Pole and the Equator.<sup>FG</sup> * '''Interim''' (1960): {{val|1650763.73}} [[wavelength]]s in a [[vacuum]] of the [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] corresponding to the transition between the 2p{{sup|10}} and 5d{{sup|5}} quantum levels of the [[krypton-86]] [[atom]]. * '''Current''' (1983): The distance travelled by light in vacuum in <math>\frac{1}{299792458}</math> second. |- ![[kilogram]]<br><ref group="n">Despite the prefix "kilo-", the kilogram is the coherent base unit of mass, and is used in the definitions of derived units.
