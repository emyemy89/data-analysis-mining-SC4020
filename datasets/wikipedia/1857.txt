<title>CLinux</title><text>{{lowercase}} '''CLinux''' {{IPA2|'mu.'si.'lnks}} is an operating system for small computers inside [[integrated circuit]]s (chips). The system is based on the [[Linux]] operating system in many ways. Apart from the rather big size of Linux, CLinux is much smaller and not as packed with features as Linux. It finds uses in many places, mostly dealing with [[sensor]] and [[Information|data]]-gathering of different sorts.  Thanks to its compact nature, it can easily be transferred over slow connections. Yet it is a stable and robust system distributed as an open source program. {{tech-stub}} [[Category:Operating systems|CLinux]]</text>
