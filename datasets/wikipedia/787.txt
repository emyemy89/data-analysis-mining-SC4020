<title>Coordinated Universal Time</title><text>{{Time zones of Europe}} '''Coordinated Universal Time''' (or '''UTC''') is the [[standard]] [[time zone|time system]] of the [[world]]. It is the standard by which the world regulates [[clocks]] and time. It is, within about 1 second, [[Solar time#Mean solar time|mean solar time]] at 0 [[longitude]].   The standard before was [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT). UTC and GMT are almost the same. In fact, there is no practical difference which would be noticed by ordinary people.<ref>Guinot, Bernard 2011.

It offers one time for all the [[Internet]] (the same time can be used by people all over the world).   Time zones are often named by how many hours they are different from UTC time. For example, UTC5 ([[United States]] east coast) is 5 hours behind UTC. If the time is 07:00 UTC, the local time is 02:00 in [[New York City|New York]] (UTC5) and 10:00 in [[Moscow]] (UTC+3).  07:00 UTC is also written more simply as 0700Z (or 07:00Z).  Note that UTC uses the 24-hour clock.  That means there is no 'AM' or 'PM'. For example, 4:00PM would be 16:00 or 1600.
