Stones visible today are shown coloured]]  '''Stonehenge''' is a [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] [[World Heritage Site]] of [[megalith]]s eight miles (13 kilometers) north of [[Salisbury]] in [[Wiltshire]], [[England]].<ref>UNESCO, [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/373 "Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites"]; retrieved 2012-4-19.</ref> It is made of a [[henge]],<ref>Remains of a former ring bank and ditch</ref> with [[standing stone]]s in [[circle]]s.  There were three main building phases, each between about 3100 BC and 1950 BC. The first circle, ~3000 BC, was made of [[timber]]. The post holes for the timber have been found. Around 2600 BC, the builders gave up timber in favour of stone. Most of the construction took place between 2640 and 2480 BC.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/30/AR2007013000661.html|title=An ancient settlement is unearthed near Stonehenge|author=Marc Kaufman|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=January 31, 2007|accessdate=2008-05-23}}</ref> Scientists have discovered that the Stonehenge builders originated from modern day [[Turkey]] from DNA analysis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47938188|title=DNA reveals origin of Stonehenge builders|last=Rincon|first=Paul|date=2019-04-16|accessdate=2019-04-20|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/news/2019-04-16/stonehenge-builders-came-from-as-far-as-modern-day-turkey-dna-suggests/|title=Stonehenge builders came from as far as modern-day Turkey, DNA suggests|website=ITV News|language=en|accessdate=2019-04-20}}</ref>  == History == === Bluestones === The first [[stone circle]] was a set of 'bluestones'. The holes held up to 80 standing stones (shown blue on the plan), only 43 of which can be traced today.  The bluestones (made of [[dolerite]], an [[igneous rock]]), are thought to have been brought from the [[Preseli Hills]], {{convert|160|mi|abbr=off}} away in modern-day [[Pembrokeshire]], [[Wales]].<ref name="Antiquity">{{cite journal |last1=Parker Pearson |first1=Michael |displayauthors=etal |date=December 2015 |title=Craig Rhos-y-felin: a Welsh bluestone megalith quarry for Stonehenge |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=6&fid=10057092&jid=AQY&volumeId=89&issueId=348&aid=10057091&bodyId=&membershipNumber=&societyETOCSession=&fulltextType=RA&fileId=S0003598X15001775 |journal=Antiquity |publisher= Antiquity Publications Ltd, |volume=89 |issue=348 |pages=13311352 |doi=10.15184/aqy.2015.177 |accessdate=15 December 2015}}</ref>   This, the long distance human transport theory, was bolstered in 2011 by the discovery of a megalithic bluestone quarry at [[Craig Rhos-y-felin]], near [[Crymych]] in Pembrokeshire. This is the most likely place where some of the stones were got.<ref name="Antiquity"/> Another theory is that they were brought much nearer to the site as [[glacial erratics]] by the [[Irish Sea Glacier]].<ref>John, Brian 2007: ''[http://www.brianjohn.f2s.com/enigma1.html The Stonehenge Bluestonesglacial transport back in favour] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901221137/http://www.brianjohn.f2s.com/enigma1.html |date=2010-09-01 }}''</ref> This theory is not preferred, because there is no evidence of glacial deposition within southern central England.  === Sarsen stones === Later, ~2400 BC, 30 huge grey sarsen stones were brought to the site. They were erected in a circle 33 metres in diameter, with lintels on top of the standing stones. The remaining bluestones were placed as an inner circle. The site was in use until the [[Bronze Age]]. The modern Stonehenge consists entirely of original stones, some of which have been replaced in upright position.  The stones may have come from a quarry about 25 miles (40 km) north of Stonehenge on the [[Marlborough|Marlborough Downs]], or they may have been collected from a "litter" of sarsens on the [[chalk downs]], which are closer.   The stones were 'dressed' (worked on) and given [[mortice and tenon]] joints. 30 were erected as a 33 metres (108 ft) diameter circle of standing stones, with a ring of 30 [[lintel]] stones resting on top. The lintels were fitted to one another using another [[woodworking]] method, the [[tongue and groove joint]]. Each standing stone was about 4.1 metres (13 ft) high, 2.1 metres (6 ft 11 in) wide and weighed about 25 tons.  === Neighbouring sites === There are also several [[passage tomb]]s and many [[Tumulus|tumuli]] nearby.  Stonehenge, however, does have a number of satellite structures which are part of the 'ritual landscape': *[[Bluehenge]]/Bluestonehenge: a new discovery, one mile to the southeast. *[[Durrington Walls]]: a Neolithic settlement two miles northeast of Stonehenge. *[[Normanton Down Barrows]]: a Neolithic and Bronze Age [[barrow]] [[cemetery]]. *[[Stonehenge Avenue]]: leads two miles from Stonehenge to [[Bluehenge]] on the River [[River Avon|Avon]]. *[[Stonehenge Cursus]]: the largest monument in the area, not easily visible on the ground. *[[Woodhenge]]: found in 1925 by an aerial survey. It had a henge and a wooden circle.  == Function == No one knows who built Stonehenge or why they built it. During the [[summer|summer solstice]], the [[sunrise]] lines up with some of the stones in a particular way. This suggests that the arrangement of stones may work as a [[calendar]]. In [[Egypt]] and [[South America]], similar ancient [[building]]s can be found. They also show the time of the solstice.  Stonehenge itself is owned by the [[Monarchy|Crown]] and managed by [[English Heritage]]. The surrounding land is owned by the [[National Trust]].<ref>{{cite web | title =How did Stonehenge come into the care of English Heritage?| work =FAQs on Stonehenge| publisher =[[English Heritage]]  | url =http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.4189| accessdate =2007-12-17  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title =Ancient ceremonial landscape of great archaeological and wildlife interest | work =Stonehenge Landscape| publisher =National Trust  | url =http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/stonehengelandscape| accessdate =2007-12-17  }}</ref>  The World Heritage Site includes [[Avebury]] and Stonhenge together, though they are quite distinct.   == Related pages == * [[List of World Heritage Sites of the United Kingdom]] * [[Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites]]  == References == {{Reflist}}  ==Further reading== *Malone, Caroline. 2005.
