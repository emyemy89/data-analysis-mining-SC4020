<title>Capital city</title><text>{{see also|List of national capitals}} [[File:Vista de Baku, Azerbaiyn, 2016-09-26, DD 117.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Baku]], the capital city of [[Azerbaijan]]]]  A '''capital city''', or '''capital town''' or '''capital''', is a [[city]] or [[town]], specified by [[law]] or [[constitution]], by the [[government]] of a [[country]], or part of a country, such as a [[state]], [[province]], or [[county]]. It usually serves as the location of the government's central [[meeting]] place and [[office]]s. Most of the country's [[leader]]s and [[official]]s work in the capital city.  == Size == Capitals are usually among the largest cities in their regions and often are the biggest. For example, [[Montevideo]] is [[Uruguay]]'s capital and its biggest city. The capital may also be the most important center of [[commerce]], as in [[London]] or [[Bangkok]].  However, a capital is not always the largest city in a country.  For example, the capital of the [[India]] is [[New Delhi]], which is smaller than [[Mumbai]].  The capital of [[Pakistan]] is [[Islamabad]], which is smaller than [[Karachi]].   In countries with subdivisions like the [[United States]], the capitals of the federated states are often not the biggest cities.  For example, [[New York City]] is the biggest city in the [[United States]] and in [[New York State]], but is not the capital of either.  The capital the country is [[Washington, DC]], and the capital of the state is [[Albany]].  An unusual case exists in [[Canada]] since the federal capital, [[Ottawa]], is not the largest city in its province, [[Ontario]], which is [[Toronto]].  However, Toronto is the capital of Ontario, so Toronto is a provincial capital but not a federal one.  == Number == Some countries have more than one capital for different purposes.  For example, [[Bolivia]] has two ([[Sucre]] and [[La Paz]]) and [[South Africa]] has three ([[Pretoria]], [[Cape Town]], and [[Bloemfontein]]).  In a [[city-state]] like [[Singapore]], [[Monaco]], and the [[Vatican City]], the capital is the country.  Not all countries have capitals. [[Nauru]] is a country that does not officially have a capital, but the district of [[Yaren]], which is where the government is, can be called the ''[[de facto]]'' capital. Also, although many people consider the city of [[Bern]] in [[Switzerland]] to be the capital of the country, it is by law not the capital but the "[[:en:federal city|federal city]]."  == Location == Capitals can be in cities that are already there like [[London]] or [[Rome]], or a [[new town]] can be built and made the capital like [[Canberra]] and [[Alexandria]]. Countries can change capitals from time to time. Several cities have been the capital of [[China]]. The [[United States]] once had its capital in [[Philadelphia]] and later in [[New York City]] but moved to the new city of [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1800. [[Rio de Janeiro]] was the capital of [[Brazil]] until the new city of [[Brasilia]] was built between 1956 and 1960.  == Seat of government == Most countries have their seat of government within their capital. However, [[Malaysia]] has its capital at [[Kuala Lumpur]], but its seat of government is at [[Putrajaya]]. In the [[Netherlands]], the [[constitution]] calls [[Amsterdam]] the capital, but the seat of government is [[The Hague]].  {{commonscat|Capitals}} [[Category:Capital cities| ]]</text>
