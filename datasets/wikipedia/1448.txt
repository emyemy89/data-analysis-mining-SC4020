<title>Glass rod</title><text>'''Glass rods''' are sometimes used as [[stir]]rers in [[laboratory]] [[environment]]s.  [[Glass]] rods are often used to spread [[liquid]]s [[even]]ly onto something. An example would be to coat glass surfaces with liquids to look at them under a [[microscope]].  Glass rods rubbed with [[silk]] or [[fur]] were used in early demonstrations of electrical energy.   Glass rods are commonly manufactured in diameters of 3 mm, 6 mm, and 10 mm.  Glass is used for these rods because it does not react with most laboratory chemicals. {{tech-stub}} {{LaboratoryEquipment}}  [[Category:laboratory equipment]]</text>
