<title>Polymer</title><text>[[File:PE and PP objects.jpg|thumb|Objects made of polymers [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]]]]  A '''polymer''' is a [[molecule]], made from joining together many small molecules called [[monomer]]s.  The word "polymer" can be broken down into "poly" (meaning "many" in Greek) and "mer" (meaning "unit").  This shows how the [[chemical]] [[composition]] of a polymer consists of many smaller units (monomers) bonded together into a larger [[molecule]].  A [[chemical reaction]] bonding monomers together to make a polymer is called '''[[polymerization]]'''.    Some polymers are natural and made by [[organism]]s. [[Protein]]s have [[polypeptide]] molecules, which are natural polymers made from various [[amino acid]] monomer units.  [[Nucleic acid]]s are huge natural polymers made up of millions of [[nucleotide]] units.  [[Cellulose]] and [[starch]] (two types of [[carbohydrate]]) are also natural polymers made up of [[glucopyranose]] monomer bonded together in different ways. [[Rubber]] is a mixture of polymers. [[Plastic]]s are man-made polymers. Many [[fiber]]s are made of polymers.    If the "units" called monomers in a polymer are all the same, then the polymer is called a "homopolymer".  Homopolymers are named by adding the [[prefix]] '''poly-''' before the monomer name from which the polymer is made.  For example, a polymer made by bonding [[styrene]] monomer molecules together is called [[polystyrene]].     [[Image:Polystyrene formation.PNG|frame|center|Many [[styrene]] [[molecule]]s join together to make a [[polystyrene]] molecule.  The squiggly lines at both ends of the polymer mean that just a short section of a long molecule is shown here. ]]  If the monomers are not all the same, the polymer is called a "[[copolymer]]" or a "heteropolymer".   [[File:DisulfidbruckeV2.svg|thumb|Disulfide bridge]] Many polymer molecules are like ''chains'' where the monomer units are the links.  Polymer molecules can be straight-chain, have ''branching'' from the main chain, or ''cross-linking'' between chains.  As an example of cross-linking, sulfhydryl (-S-H) groups in two [[cysteine]] amino acid units in polypeptide chains can bond together to make a disulfide bridge (-S-S-) joining the chains together.    == Relating pages == *[[Macromolecule]]   [[Category:Polymers| ]]</text>
