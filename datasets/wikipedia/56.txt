The city used to be known as '''Peking'''.  It is in the northern and eastern parts of the country. It is the world's most populous capital city.  The city of Beijing has played a very important role in the development of China. Many people from different cities and countries come to Beijing to look for better chances to find work. Nearly 15 million people live there. In 2008 Beijing hosted the [[Summer Olympic Games]], and will host the 2022 [[Winter Olympic Games]]. It will be the only city to host both.  Beijing is well known for its ancient history.  Since the [[Jin Dynasty]], Beijing has been the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of several [[dynasties]] (especially the later ones), including the Yuan, Ming, and Qing. There are many places of historic interest in Beijing.  {{anchor|Etymology|Toponymy|Names}} ==Name== {{further|Chinese language}} The [[Mandarin Chinese]] name of the city is ''Bijng'',{{efn|These marks show the [[Chinese tones|tones]] of the [[Chinese language|Chinese word]], which are important in saying them correctly.}} which means "The Northern [[Capital (city)|Capital]]". It got this name when the [[Yongle Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] [[dynasties in Chinese history|family of rulers]] moved most of his [[government]] from [[Nanjing]] ("The Southern [[Capital (city)|Capital]]") in the early [[15th century|1400s]].  In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], Beijing's name [[Chinese characters|is written]] {{nowrap|{{lang-zh|{{linktext|}}}}.}} Today, people spell it "Beijing" because they use the [[pinyin|pinyin way of spelling]], which shows what the name should sound like in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. People used to spell it "'''Peking'''" because that was the spelling used by some of the first people from [[Europe]] to visit the Ming and write home about it; the [[Jesuit China Mission|Jesuits]]' work was made popular by their [[Kingdom of France|French]] brother [[Jean-Baptiste du Halde|Du Halde]].{{sfnp|Du Halde|1735|loc=[[:File:Du_Halde,_map_of_Beijing.jpg|Vol.{{Spaces}}I, p.{{Spaces}}135]]}} It then became the official [[Chinese Postal Map]] spelling around [[1900]] and continued to be used until pinyin became more popular.{{sfnp|Harris|2008|p=99}}  Beijing was also known as '''Beiping''' ("City of Northern Peace") between 1928 and 1949, when the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] moved the Chinese capital to [[Nanjing]] and [[Chongqing]].  == History == The center of Beijing was settled in the [[1st millennium BC]]. In those days, the Kingdom of Yan (, Yn) set up their capital where Beijing is today.<ref name="CD History">{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Beijing-History.html |title=History - Beijing |accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref> They called it Ji (, J). After the Kingdom of Yan was destroyed, the city became smaller, although it was still an important place.  Beijing became more important again in the 10th century, when the Jin dynasty set its capital there. This city was destroyed by [[Mongol]] forces in [[1215]].  Then in [[1267]], Mongols built a new city on the north side of the Jin capital, and called it "Great Capital" (, Dd), which was the beginning of modern Beijing. When [[Kublai Khan]] the Mongolian monarch, set up the Yuan dynasty, this city became his capital.  The [[Yuan Dynasty]], [[Ming Dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]] all made Beijing their capital. When the Qing dynasty lost power and the Republic of China was set up, the new Republic moved its capital from Beijing to Nanjing. When the People's Republic of China seized power, Beijing became the capital of China again.  In 1989, there were [[protest]]s in [[Tiananmen Square|Tian'anmen Square]] because some people wanted [[democracy]].<ref name="CD History" />  {{anchor|Attractions|Landmarks}} ==Special places== Important places in Beijing include: * The [[Great Wall of China]] (''Chngchng''), in the mountains between Beijing and the grasslands of [[Mongolia]] * The [[Forbidden City]] (''Ggng''), the most important home of the [[emperor of China|emperor]]s of Ming and Qing China * [[Tian'anmen Square]] (''Tin'nmn Gungchng''), surrounded by China's most important government buildings and museums * [[Jingshan Park|Jingshan]] & [[Beihai Park]]s, the hill overlooking the Forbidden City and the lake beside it, with many temples * The [[Summer Palace]] (''Yhyun'') and [[Old Summer Palace]] (''Yunmng Yun''), the more natural home of the last Qing emperors and what is left of an older one * [[Prince Gong's Mansion]], a very nice old house for one of the Qing [[prince]]s * The [[Imperial Ancestral Temple]] (''Timio''), where the emperors remembered the earlier people in their families * The [[Temple of Heaven]] (''Tintn'') and [[Temple of the Earth]] (''Dtn''), important places for China's old national religion * The [[Temple of the Sun (Beijing)|Temples of the Sun]] and [[Temple of the Moon (Beijing)|the Moon]], other important places for China's old national religion * The [[Beijing Temple of Confucius|Temple of Confucius]] and [[Chinese Imperial Academy|Imperial Academy]], important places for China's old kind of education * [[Niujie Mosque]], a place for Beijing's [[Muslims]] and one of the city's oldest buildings * The [[National Museum of China|National]] and [[Beijing Urban Planning Museum|Urban Planning Museum]]s * [[Olympic Green]], the park left from the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]] * [[Marco Polo Bridge]], a very old bridge across the main river west of town * [[Ming Tombs]], where many Ming [[emperor of China|emperors]] were [[burial|buried]] * [[Zhoukoudian]], caves in the mountains west of town where people lived long, long ago  == Education == Beijing is the education center of People's Republic of China.
