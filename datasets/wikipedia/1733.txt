The people in the band are Conor Oberst, a [[singer]]-[[songwriter]]; Mike Mogis, a [[musician]] and [[producer]]; and other friends and session musicians from [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], USA.  Oberst's singing style and the words to the [[song]]s are called [[desperate]] or on the verge of [[tear]]s. Many people think his songs are always about himself, but Oberst has said that they are not. For example, one song, "Padraic My Prince", tells the [[fiction]]al story of a mother drowning her son in a [[bathtub]]. In [[interview]]s, Oberst has said that he sings about such things to make rich emotions.  ==Discography== ===Albums=== *''Letting Off the Happiness'' (1998) *''Fevers and Mirrors'' (2000) *''A Collection of Songs: Recorded 1995-1997'' (2000) *''Lifted or the Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground'' (2002) *''Vinyl Box Set'' (7 LP's) (2003)  This collection contains Oberst's first five releases plus bonus material. *''I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning'' (2005) *''Digital Ash in a Digital Urn'' (2005) *''Cassadaga'' (2007) *''The People's Key'' (2011)  ===EPs/Singles=== *''Every Day and Every Night'' EP (1999) *"Don't Be Frightened Of Turning The Page" (2001) *"Oh Holy Fools: The Music of Son, Ambulance & Bright Eyes" (2001)  *"Drunk Kid Catholic" CDS (2001) *''There Is No Beginning To The Story'' EP (2002) *''Lover I Don't Have To Love'' CDS (2002) *''Home: IV'' EP (2004) *''One Jug of Wine, Two Vessels'' EP (2004) *"Lua" (2004) *''Take It Easy (Love Nothing)'' (2004) *''Four Winds'' EP (2007)  [[Category:American rock bands]] [[Category:Indie bands]] [[Category:Electronic music bands]] [[Category:Musical groups from Nebraska]] [[Category:Musicians from Omaha, Nebraska]] [[Category:Musical groups established in 1995]] [[Category:1995 establishments in the United States]] [[Category:20th-century establishments in Nebraska]]</text>
