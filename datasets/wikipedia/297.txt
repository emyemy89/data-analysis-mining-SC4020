({{IPAc-en||m||n|t|r|i|||l}}, spelled ''Montral'' in [[French language|French]]) is a [[city]] in the country of [[Canada]]. It is the largest city in the [[province]] of [[Quebec]] and the second-largest city in Canada. It is the second-largest [[French language|French-speaking]] city in the world after [[Paris]].  Montreal is built on an island sitting in the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. More than three million people live in the Montreal region. At the centre of Montreal is a mountain called [[Mount Royal]]. The suburb of [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount]], is a very affluent suburb of Quebec.  Most of the people who live in Montreal speak [[French language|French]], but [[English language|English]] is also commonly spoken, as a [[second language]].  == History == The name 'Montral' comes from ''Mont Royal'', which means 'Royal Mountain' in [[French language|French]]. It was originally called ''Ville-Marie'', or City of Mary.  Montreal has always played a very important part in the history and development of Canada. It continues to be a large Canadian industrial and commercial centre, as well as a major seaport (via the Saint Lawrence River). It once was the largest city in Canada, before [[Toronto]] grew to be larger.  Tourists visit Montreal for its historical and cultural interest. One can visit the Old City in horse-drawn carriages, where many buildings from the earliest years stand and remind of the way of life that started in the [[New World]], when Montreal was just a fur trading outpost belonging to [[France]] over 350 years ago.  ==Geography== Montreal is in the southwest of [[Quebec]], 530 [[kilometres]] north of [[New York City]]. The city itself is located on an [[island]], the Island of Montreal. Near the downtown area, there is a hill called ''Mount Royal'' (''Mont Royal'' in French).  == Economy == [[File:TourDeLaBourse night.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The [[stock exchange]] tower in downtown Montreal]] Montreal's [[economy]] is the second largest in [[Canada]]. The city's [[port]] is the biggest inland port (a port that is not on the [[sea]]) in the world. Many large corporations have their main offices in Montreal. It also hosts many international organizations like [[ICAO]], the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]], and [[IATA]]. The city is home to four major [[university|Universities]], welcoming students from all parts of Canada and from all over the world.  Montreal is also known for its [[culture|cultural]] production sector. Because the city has many different buildings, [[movie]]s are easy to film there. The [[circus]] troupe (group) ''Cirque du Soleil'' is from Montreal. The city is also known for its festivals, like the Montreal Jazz Festival and ''Just For Laughs''.  Some [[video game]] companies also have studios in Montreal.  == Culture == [[File:CentrevilleMontrealt.jpg|thumb|200px|Downtown area seen from across the Saint Lawrence River]]  Montreal has many beautiful [[church]]es (Montreal is referred to locally as 'the city of a hundred churches'), including the largest church in Canada, and also many important art, history, and science museums. You can also visit the location of the 1967 [[World's Fair]], where today, as well as many other attractions, one will find the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve [[Formula One]] automobile race course. Also of interest is the site where the 1976 Summer [[Olympic Games]] were held, and the modern architecture of the Olympic stadium (the 'Big O') and its tall inclined observation tower (the highest inclined tower in the world); now a landmark of Montreal.  A lot of Montrealers are interested in [[ice hockey|hockey]], and Montreal is home to its own ice hockey team called the [[Montreal Canadiens]] who play in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).  == Media ==  [[Montreal Stations]]  [[CBMT]] [[CBC]]  [[CFCF]] [[CTV Television Network]]  [[CIVM]] [[Tele-Quebec]]  [[CJNT]] [[CH]]  [[CFTU]] [[Canal Savoir]]  [[CKMI]] [[Global Television Network]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  == Other websites == {{Commons}} * [http://ville.montreal.qc.ca Official website] * [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Montreal Montreal] -Citizendium  [[Category:Montreal| ]] [[Category:Olympic cities]]</text>
