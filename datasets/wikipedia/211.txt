<title>Hawaii (island)</title><text>[[Image:Hawai'i.jpg|thumb|Hawaii island]]  The '''Island of Hawaii''' is the largest [[United States|U.S.]] [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian Island]], and it is the farthest south. It is also called the "Big Island." Its area is 4,038 sq. miles (10 458 square kilometers). The widest part of the island is 93 miles (150 km) across. The Big Island has more than half (~62%) of the total land area of [[Hawaii|State of Hawaii]]. It is part of [[Hawaii County, Hawaii|County of Hawaii]].  The island is seven separate [[shield volcano]]s that erupted more or less one at a time, one partly covering the other. These are (from oldest to youngest): [[Kohala]] ([[extinct volcano|extinct]]), [[Mauna Kea]] ([[Dormant volcano|dormant]]), [[Hualalai]] (dormant), [[Mauna Loa]] ([[Active volcano|active]]), Kulani (extinct, mostly buried), and [[Kilauea]] (very active). The volcanos were caused by the Pacific oceanic [[tectonic]] plate moving over a [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]. There [[lava]] from the Earth's lower [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] or upper [[Earth's core|core]] is close to the surface.  The largest city on the island is [[Hilo]]. Hilo has many historic buildings, interesting shops, parks, many performances, festivals and events. It is on the rainy, east side of the [[island]]. The city of [[Kailua-Kona]] is on the dry, west side of Hawaii, and is popular with [[tourists]].  ==Reference== {{commonscat|Hawaii (island)}} *MacDonald, G. A., and A. T. Abbott. 1970.
