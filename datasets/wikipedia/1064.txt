From a grave in [[Armento]], [[Campania]]]]  {{about|the metal|the color|Gold (color)}}  '''Gold''' is a soft, dense, yellow [[metal]]. It is a [[chemical element]]. Its [[chemical symbol]] is '''Au'''. Its [[atomic number]] is 79. As a [[precious metal]], it has been used for many thousands of years by people all over the world, for [[jewelry]], and as [[money]]. Gold is important because it is [[scarcity|rare]], but also easier to use than other rare metals. It is also used to repair and replace [[teeth]] and in electronic equipment such as [[computer]]s. The [[color]] of this metal is also called ''[[Gold (colour)|gold]]''.  [[Mining]] methods for gold are similar to other metals. Gold is so valued that the discovery of a new place to mine has sometimes caused a [[gold rush]]. The deepest workplaces for miners in the world are in [[South Africa]]<nowiki/>n gold mines.  Often, gold is found as a [[native metal]]. This means it is not part of an [[ore]], and does not need [[smelting]]. It may be in large, pure nuggets but more often must be separated from other minerals and soil.  Most of the gold on Earth is deep inside the [[Earth's core]] because it is dense. Nearly all discovered gold was deposited on the surface by[[meteorite]]s.  == Properties == In [[chemistry]], gold is [[chemical element]] 79, a [[transition metal]] in Group 11. It has an [[atomic weight]] of 199.966 a.m.u. Its [[symbol]] is '''Au''', from the [[Latin]] word for gold, ''aurum''. It is a "[[noble metal]]" meaning it has low [[Reactivity (chemistry)|chemical reactivity]].  Gold is very soft. It is [[Malleability|malleable]], meaning a [[goldsmith]] can hammer it into thin metal sheets. It is also [[Ductility|ductile]], which means it can be pulled into [[wire]]. When it is used in money or in [[Jewellery|jewelry]], it is often [[alloy]]ed with [[silver]] or some other metal to make it harder.  Most metals are gray in color. Gold is yellow because of the way its [[electron]]s behave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/gold_color.html|title=Relativity in Chemistry|publisher=Math.ucr.edu|accessdate=2009-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|journal = Chemical Physics|volume = 311|pages = 151161|title = Understanding gold chemistry through relativity|doi = 10.1016/j.chemphys.2004.09.023|first = Hubert|last = Schmidbaur|coauthors = Cronje, Stephanie; Djordjevic, Bratislav; Schuster, Oliver|year = 2005|issue = 12|bibcode = 2005CP....311..151S }}</ref> The only other metal in common use that has a non-gray color is [[copper]]. [[Caesium]] also has a gold-like color, but it is not commonly used as a metal because it reacts with water.  Gold is a fairly good electrical conductor, but not as good as copper or silver. Copper and brass electrical connectors, especially those used with computer and audio/video equipment, are often plated with gold for corrosion resistance. [[File:Nancy Johnson.jpg|thumb|[[Nancy Johnson]] and her [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medal]]  == Language and culture == Gold can mean that something or someone is very good or has done very well. A gold [[medal]] is often the given to the first-place winner in a race or other sports. Something that is in some way good may be given [[gold status]].  == Safety == Metallic gold is non-toxic, which is unusual for a [[Heavy metals|heavy metal]]. Soluble gold compounds, however, are [[Poison|toxic]] to the liver and kidneys. Gold is non-flammable, even in a pure oxygen environment or when finely powdered. It does not react with most household or laboratory chemicals. Gold is commonly processed with [[cyanide]], which is highly toxic.  Most of the cyanide is destroyed in the production process, so it is not present in the final product, but it can be a hazard to workers in a gold processing plant. Since gold conducts electricity, gold jewelry should never be worn when working with electricity.  == References == {{Reflist}}  == Other websites == {{commonscat|Gold}} {{wiktionary}} * [http://education.jlab.org/itselemental/ele079.html Atomic Properties] * [http://www.goldinstitute.org/ Gold Institute] * [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Gold Gold] -Citizendium {{Periodic Table}}  [[Category:Basic English 850 words]] [[Category:Gold]]</text>
