These people are called '''inhabitants''' or '''residents'''.  The population includes all individuals that live in that certain area.The world population was estimated to have reached 7.5 billion in April 2017.  Asiais the most populous continent, with its 4.3 billion inhabitants being 60% of the [[world population]].  The most populous country is [[China]] with 1.4 billion people.  [[Population density]] is the [[average]] number of people in a place. [[Urban area]]s such as big cities have a high population density. People there live close to each other. In areas with a low population density, people usually live far away from each other, such as in [[rural area]]s out in the countryside.  Usually population refers to the number of humans in a certain area. The [[maximum]] population that can be supported in an area is called the [[carrying capacity]].  == Population trends == Global population is going up, but the [[population growth]] rate is declining all over the world.  Growth in poor countries is faster than in rich ones; some rich countries have a [[population pyramid]] that is nearly square. [[Urbanization]] is also common, and [[urban area]]<nowiki/>s usually have lower birth rates. In population growth, births exceed deaths. In the modern world this is due to reduction of [[infant mortality|infant deaths]], control of [[infectious disease]]s, and improved [[agriculture]] so more people can eat.  The change in population from 2010 to 2015 was: * World: +420 million * Africa: +146 million * Asia: +223 million * Europe: +3 million * Latin America and Caribbean: +35 million * Northern America: +14 million * Oceania: +2.9 million  Human population control is the practice of altering the rate of growth of a human population. Concerns about [[overpopulation]] and its effects on poverty, environmental degradation, and political stability led to efforts to reduce population growth rates.  == Related pages == * [[Population growth]] * [[Overpopulation]] * [[Census]]  == References == {{Commons}} {{reflist}}  == Further reading == * YAN Kun(2011).
