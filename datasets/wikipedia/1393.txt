The right one is for digging underground.]] In [[gardening]], a '''spade''' is a [[tool]] for digging. It is similar to a [[shovel]]. It has a straight handle.  For some purposes the difference between a spade and a shovel is important.  It is hard to move [[gravel]] with a spade but a proper shovel can do it.  In [[game]]s, a '''spade''' is one of the four shapes or "suits" on [[playing cards]].     {{stub}}  [[Category:Basic English 850 words]] [[Category:Gardening tools]]</text>
