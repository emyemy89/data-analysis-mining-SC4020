It is in [[Asia]], but it is often associated with [[Europe]] because of the [[culture]] and [[history]] of the people. It is also closer to [[Africa]] than to [[Europe]]. The capital is [[Nicosia]]. Most of the population speaks [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].  ==History== Cyprus is the only place outside England where an [[English people|English]] royal wedding took place. That was the wedding of [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] and [[Berengaria of Navarre]] on 12 May 1191.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F75NDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT409&dq=royal+wedding+in+cyprus+1191&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjbl-2O8cXqAhWUTsAKHUe6CGgQ6AEwBHoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=royal%20wedding%20in%20cyprus%201191&f=false|title=Lonely Planet Cyprus|last=Lee|first=Jessica|last2=Bindloss|first2=Joe|last3=Quintero|first3=Josephine|last4=|first4=|date=2018-02-01|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2018|isbn=978-1-78701-175-5|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow2014.com/celebrate/queens-baton-relay/international-stages/interactive-map/cyprus|title=Cyprus: Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games|accessdate=11 July 2020|publisher=Glasgow2014}}</ref>  Cyprus gained independence from the [[British Empire]] in 1960. The UK, Turkey and Greece became  guarantor powers of the island.  In July 1974, [[Turkey]] invaded Cyprus. Since then the northern part of the island has been under Turkish control. The '''[[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]]''' became independent in 1983 but it is recognised only by [[Turkey]]. When entering by aeroplane, a short stop is made at an airport in mainland Turkey.  The present situation with the island split came about because Cyprus, historically Greek, was conquered and became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1570{{ndash}}1914. The [[British]] administered it from 1878 until 1960. Likewise, Greece had been part of the Ottoman Empire for several centuries. Negotiations for a unified island have been held several times without success.  In 2004, Cyprus joined the [[European Union]]. On 1 January 2008 Cyprus adopted the [[Euro]], the single European currency. Northern Cyprus accepts Turkish lira, and sometimes the Euro or [[United States dollar]].  == Geography == Cyprus is the third largest island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], after the Italian islands of [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]].  There are two mountain ranges, the [[Troodos Mountains]] and the smaller [[Kyrenia Mountains|Kyrenia Range]]. The [[Pedieos River]] is the longest on the island.  The highest point on Cyprus is [[Mount Olympus (Cyprus)|Mount Olympus]] at {{convert|1952|m|abbr=off}}.  The Republic of Cyprus is only on the southern two-thirds of the island (59.74%). The [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] is the northern third (34.85%) and rest are [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] owned by the British.  == Politics == The Republic of Cyprus is a [[constitutional]] presidential [[republic]]. Each president is elected for a five-year term. The president has a lot of power. Cyprus is the only member of the European Union that is governed by a presidential system of government. It is one of few countries (along with [[San Marino]]) to have had a democratically-elected [[communist]] government, in office from 2008 until 2013. Since 2013 governing party has been the Democratic Rally.  The [[European Union]] issued a warning in February 2019 that Cyprus, an EU member, was selling EU [[passport]]s to Russian [[Oligarchy|oligarch]]s. This would allow allow [[organised crime]] syndicates to get into the EU.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/cyprus-golden-passports-bring-russians-eu-190202172320680.html|title=Cyprus 'golden passports' bring Russians into the EU|work=Al Jazeera |access-date=4 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204165732/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/cyprus-golden-passports-bring-russians-eu-190202172320680.html|archive-date=4 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2020 leaked documents revealed a range of former and current officials from [[Afghanistan]], [[China]], [[Dubai]], [[Lebanon]], the [[Russian Federation]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Vietnam]] who bought a Cypriot citizenship before a change of the law in July 2019.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/08/exclusive-cyprus-sold-passports-politically-exposed-persons-200823204320183.html|title=Exclusive: Cyprus sold passports to 'politically exposed persons'|work=Al Jazeera|access-date=24 August 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rakopoulos |first1=Theodoros |last2=Fischer |first2=Leandros |title=In Cyprus, the Golden Passports Scheme Shows Us How Capitalism and Corruption Go Hand in Hand |journal=Jacobin |date=10 November 2020 |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2020/11/cyprus-golden-passports-citizenship-corruption |accessdate=13 November 2020}}</ref> Cyprus and [[Turkey]] have been engaged in a dispute over the extent of their [[exclusive economic zone]]s.
