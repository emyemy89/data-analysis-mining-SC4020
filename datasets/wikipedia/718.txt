<title>Wikipedia:Template messages</title><text>{{guideline|WP:TM|WP:TEMP|WP:TEMPLATES|WP:TPLATE}} [[Template]]s are used within pages to provide the same message over and over again. Changes to the look, wording, or style of the message can be done quickly, because templates are made again for the reader when the article loads.  In other words, when the message is changed, you do not need to update a page that uses it if you use a template. Standard notices that might be on a page for months or forever should be "[[:en:Wikipedia:Transclusion|transcluded]]" for easy updating. This loads the current version of the message and puts it on the page every time you load it.   Some templates are used to tell people something about the article. Other templates (also called navboxes) are used to give links to other articles. These templates are in [[:Category:Navigational boxes]].  For any of these messages, you can include "subst:" (as in <nowiki>{{</nowiki>[[Template:1911|subst:1911]]}}) when inserting them to put the full text into the page. Doing this means that any future changes to the template will not be shown in that article, but it can be useful sometimes.  To make a new message, start a page in the Template namespace. The title should be "Template:", then the name of your message. The page should then be written with the text of your message. Add your new template to this list.  ==Article content==  These templates are used to let people know about issues with the information in the article.  {| border="1" |- ! Name !! Current text !!
