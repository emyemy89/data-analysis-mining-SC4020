<title>Chemical reaction</title><text>[[File:Rust03102006.JPG|thumb|200px|Rusting iron]] [[File:Large bonfire.jpg|thumb|200px|A bonfire is an example for [[redox]]]]  A '''chemical reaction''' happens when one or more [[chemical]]s are changed into one or more other chemicals. Examples:  * [[iron]] and [[oxygen]] combining to make [[rust]] * [[vinegar]] and [[baking soda]] combining to make [[sodium]] [[acetate]], [[carbon dioxide]] and water * things burning or exploding * many reactions that happen inside living things, such as [[photosynthesis]] * [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]] reactions when discharging or recharging [[Battery|batteries]]  Some reactions are fast, and others are slow. Some happen at different speeds, depending on [[temperature]] or other things. For example, [[wood]] does not react with [[air]] when it is cold, but if it is made hot enough, it will start to burn. Some reactions give out [[energy]]. These are [[exothermic reaction]]s. In other reactions, energy is taken in. These are [[endothermic reaction]]s.  [[Nuclear reaction]]s are ''not'' chemical reactions. Chemical reactions involve only the [[electrons]] of atoms; nuclear reactions involve the [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] in the [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]].  == Four basic types == [[File:Chemical reactions.svg|thumb|center|500px|The four basic chemical reactions types: synthesis, decomposition, single replacement and double replacement]]  === Synthesis === In a synthesis reaction, two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance.   :<math>A + B \longrightarrow AB</math>  "Two or more reactants giving one product" is another way to identify a synthesis reaction. One example of a synthesis reaction is the combination of [[iron]] and [[sulfur]] to form [[iron(II) sulfide]]:  :<math>8Fe + S_8 \longrightarrow 8FeS</math>  Another example is simple hydrogen gas combined with simple oxygen gas to produce a more complex substance, such as water.<ref name="to react or not to react">[http://utahscience.oremjr.alpine.k12.ut.us/sciber99/8th/matter/sciber/chemtype.htm To react or not to react?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110214558/http://utahscience.oremjr.alpine.k12.ut.us/sciber99/8th/matter/sciber/chemtype.htm |date=2015-01-10 }} Utah State Office of Education. Retrieved 4 June 2011</ref>  === Decomposition === A decomposition reaction is when a more complex substance breaks down into its more simple parts. It is thus the opposite of a synthesis reaction, and can be written as:<ref name="to react or not to react"/><ref name="chemical reactions">[http://misterguch.brinkster.net/6typesofchemicalrxn.html Six types of chemical reactions]  MrGuch ChemFiesta.</ref>  :<math>AB \longrightarrow A + B</math>  One example of a decomposition reaction is the [[electrolysis]] of water to make [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]] gas:  :<math>2H_2O \longrightarrow 2H_2 + O_2</math>  Another example of a decomposition reaction is [[calcium carbonate]] breaking down into [[calcium oxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]] under high temperatures:  CaCO<sub>3</sub> > CaO + CO<sub>2</sub>  === Single replacement === In a single replacement reaction, a single uncombined element replaces another in a [[chemical compound|compound]]; in other words, one element trades places with another element in a compound<ref name="to react or not to react"/> These reactions come in the general form of:  :<math>A + BC \longrightarrow AC + B</math>  One example of a single displacement reaction is when [[magnesium]] replaces [[hydrogen]] in [[water]] to make [[magnesium hydroxide]] and hydrogen gas:  :<math>Mg + 2H_2O \longrightarrow Mg(OH)_2 + H_2</math>  === Double replacement === In a double replacement reaction, the anions and cations of two compounds switch places and form two entirely different compounds.<ref name="to react or not to react"/> These reactions are in the general form:<ref name="chemical reactions"/>  :<math>AB + CD \longrightarrow AD + CB</math>  For example, when [[barium chloride]] (BaCl<sub>2</sub>) and [[magnesium sulfate]] (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) react, the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup> anion switches places with the 2Cl<sup></sup> anion, giving the compounds BaSO<sub>4</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub>.  Another example of a double displacement reaction is the reaction of [[lead(II) nitrate]] with [[potassium iodide]] to form [[lead(II) iodide]] and [[potassium nitrate]]:  :<math>Pb(NO_3)_2 + 2 KI \longrightarrow PbI_2 + 2 KNO_3</math>  == Equations == A chemical reaction is being displayed by an equation: :<math>\mathrm{ A + B \longrightarrow C + D}</math> :<small>Here, A and B react to C and D in a chemical reaction.</small>  : This is an example of a '''combustion reaction'''.  <math>\mathrm{C + O_2 \longrightarrow CO_2}</math>  : <small>[[carbon]] + [[oxygen]]  [[carbon dioxide]] </small>  == Related pages == * [[Organic reaction]] * [[Redox]]  == Other websites == * [http://www.purchon.com/chemistry/rates.htm Rates of reaction] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305222603/http://www.purchon.com/chemistry/rates.htm |date=2007-03-05 }} * [http://www.webqc.org/balance.php Online chemical equation balancer] Balances equation of any chemical reaction (full or half-cell) in one click.  ==References== {{Reflist}}  [[Category:Chemistry]]</text>
