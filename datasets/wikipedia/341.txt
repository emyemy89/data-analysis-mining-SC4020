It is found today on only three [[Hawaiian islands]].<ref name=bbc>{{Cite web  |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/wear/low/people_and_places/nature/newsid_8549000/8549716.stm  |title=BBC - Wear - Rare bird lays first spring eggs  |work=news.bbc.co.uk  |access-date=22 March 2010 }}</ref> It gets its name from its soft call.  This is an unmistakable species, with its generally brown plumage (feathers) and darker head. Its strong toes have much reduced webbing (skin between the toes), an adjustment to the [[lava]] flows on which it breeds.<ref name=fifty/> The Nn goes about on land much more than other water birds. When moulting (dropping old feathers and growing new ones), the Nn cannot fly, as do other geese, a factor which made it vulnerable to hunting.  The Nn was once among the most [[wikt:threaten|threatened]] [[waterfowl]] [[species]] around the world.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ducks.org/hunting/waterfowl-id/hawaiian-nene-goose |title=Hawaiian 'Nene' Goose Facts, Figures, Description and Photo |work=ducks.org |access-date=7 April 2011}}</ref> Once common, hunting and [[predator]]s brought to the islands such as [[mongoose]]s, [[pig]]s and [[cat]]s reduced the population to only 30 birds in the 1950s.<ref name=bbc/> However, this species breeds well in captivity (zoos and bird parks), and has been successfully re-introduced. There are also good numbers in wild bird collections.  The Nn is the state bird of [[Hawaii]].<ref name=fifty>{{Cite web  |url= http://www.50states.com/bird/nene.htm  |title=Hawaii State Bird - Nene - Hawaiian Goose  |work=50states.com  |access-date=22 March 2010 }}</ref>  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{-}} {{biology-stub}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Nene}} [[Category:Geese]]</text>
