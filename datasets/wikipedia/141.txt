It is much smaller than the [[gas giant]]s such as [[Jupiter]].  === Chemical make-up === Overall, Earth is made of [[iron]] (32.1[[percent|%]]), [[oxygen]] (30.1[[percent|%]]), [[silicon]] (15.1[[percent|%]]), [[magnesium]] (13.9[[percent|%]]), [[sulfur]] (2.9[[percent|%]]), [[nickel]] (1.8[[percent|%]]), [[calcium]] (1.5[[percent|%]]), and [[aluminium]] (1.4[[percent|%]]). The 1.2[[percent|%]] left over is made of many different kinds of other chemicals. Chemicals that are very uncommon (such as [[gold]] and [[platinum]]) can be very valuable.  The structure of Earth changes from the inside to the outside. The [[Planetary core|center of earth]] ([[Earth's core]]) is mostly iron (88.8%), nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% other things.<ref>Morgan J.W. & Anders E. 1980.

Oxygen is normally a gas but it can [[oxide|join]] with other [[chemicals]] to make [[chemical compound|compounds]] like [[water]] and rocks. 99.22[[percent|%]] of rocks have [[oxygen]] in them. The most common [[oxygen]]-having rocks are [[silica]] (made with [[silicon]]), [[alumina]] (made with [[aluminum|aluminium]]), [[rust]] (made with [[iron]]), [[lime (chemical)|lime]] (made with [[calcium]]), [[magnesia]] (made with [[magnesium]]), [[potash]] (made with [[potassium]]), and [[sodium]] oxide, and there are others as well.<ref>Chisholm, Hugh (editor). 1911.

The shape is called an [[oblate spheroid]]. As Earth spins around itself, [[centrifugal force]] forces the [[equator]] out a little and pulls the [[geographical pole|poles]] in a little. The equator, around the middle of Earth's surface, is about {{convert|40,075|km|mi|sp=us|disp=or|sigfig=4}} long.<ref>Measuring the Earth is part of [[geodesy]]</ref>  The highest mountain above [[sea level]]&mdash;the well-known [[Mount Everest]] (which is {{convert|8848|m|abbr=off|disp=or}} [[elevation|above sea level]])&mdash;is ''not'' actually the one that is the farthest away from the center of the Earth. Instead, the sleeping [[volcano]] [[Mount Chimborazo]] in [[Ecuador]] is; it is only {{convert| 6263|m|abbr=off|disp=or}} [[elevation|above sea level]] but it is almost at the [[equator]]. Because of this, Mount Chimborazo is {{convert|6,384|km|abbr=off|disp=or}} from the center of the Earth, while [[Mount Everest]] is {{convert|2|km|abbr=off|disp=or}} closer to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.profsurv.com/archive.php?issue=42&article=589|title=Did Edmund Hillary climb the wrong mountain?|work = Professional Surveyor Magazine | volume=20 |issue=5 |first = Joseph H. |last = Senne| date = May 2000|accessdate = 2008-10-24}}</ref><ref name="lancet365_9462_831">{{cite journal | last=Sharp | first=David | title=Chimborazo and the old kilogram | journal=The Lancet | date=2005-03-05 | volume=365 | issue=9462 | pages=831832 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71021-7 }}</ref><ref name="tall_tales">{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s1086384.htm | title=Tall tales about highest peaks | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate=2008-12-29}}</ref> Similarly, the lowest point below sea level that we are conscious of is the [[Challenger Deep]] in the [[Mariana Trench]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

In fact, the air and the outside levels are much thinner than shown here]]  The [[Kola superdeep borehole|deepest hole ever dug]] is only about {{convert|12.3|km|mi|disp=or|sp=us|sigfig=2}}. We know something about the inside of the Earth, though, because we can learn things from [[earthquake]]s and the times when [[volcano]]es [[Volcanic eruption|erupt]]. We are able to see how quickly the [[shock wave]]s move through Earth in different places.  The inside of Earth is very different from the outside. Almost all of Earth's liquid water is in the [[ocean|sea]]s or close to the surface. The surface also has a lot of [[oxygen]], which comes from plants. Small and simple kinds of life can live far under the surface, but animals and plants only live on the surface or in the seas. The rocks on the surface of Earth ([[Earth's crust]]) are well known. They are thicker where there is land, between {{convert|30|to|50|km|mi|disp=or|sp=us|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} thick. Under the [[ocean|sea]]s they are sometimes only {{convert|6|km|mi|disp=or|sp=us|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} thick.<ref>{{cite web|author=Toshiro Tanimoto|first=|date=|title=Crustal Surface of the Earth|url=http://www.agu.org/reference/gephys/15_tanimoto.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030410215144/http://www.agu.org/reference/gephys/15_tanimoto.pdf|archive-date=April 10, 2003|accessdate=2009-08-02|website=|publisher=American Geophysical Union}}</ref> There are three groups of rocks that make up most of the Earth's crust. Some rock is made when the hot liquid rock comes from inside the earth ([[igneous rock]]s); another type of rock is made when [[sediment]] is laid down, usually under the sea ([[sedimentary rock]]s); and a third kind of rock is made when the other two are changed by very high [[temperature]] or [[pressure]] ([[metamorphic rock]]s). A very few rocks also fall out of the sky ([[meteorite]]s).  Below the crust is warm and almost-[[liquid]] rock that is always moving around (the [[Earth's mantle]]). Then, there is a thin liquid layer of heated rock (the [[outer core]]). This is very hot: {{convert|7000|C|F K|disp=or|sigfig=2}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chianti.geol.ucl.ac.uk/~dario/pubblicazioni/PTRSA2002.pdf|title=The ab initio simulation of the Earths core|date=2002-04-25|accessdate=2009-08-02|publisher=The Royal Society|author=D.

This solid middle part (the [[inner core]]) is almost all [[iron]].

The slow movement of the plates is what causes [[earthquake]]s, [[volcano]]es and large groups of mountains on the Earth.  There are three ways plates can come together. Two plates can move towards each other ("convergent" plate edges). This can form [[island]]s (such as [[Japan]]), [[volcanoes]], and high [[mountain range]]s (such as the [[Andes]] and [[Himalayas]]).<ref name="book1">{{cite book| last1 = Seyfert| first1 = Carl K.| last2 = Seyfert| first2 = Carl| last3 = Seyfert| first3 = Claus| title = The encyclopedia of structural geology and plate tectonics| url = https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofst0000unse| year = 1987| publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-0-442-28125-0 }}</ref> Two plates can move away from each other ("divergent" plate edges).

There are high places called [[mountain]]s, and high flat places called [[plateau]]s. There are low places called [[valley]]s and [[canyon]]s. For the most part, moving [[wind|air]] and [[rain|water from the sky]] and [[tide|sea]]s [[erosion|damages rocks in high places and breaks them into small pieces]]. The air and water then move these pieces to lower places. Because of this, the Earth would have been very flat a long time before now. The fundamental cause of the differences in the Earth's surface is [[plate tectonics]]. The shape of the entire planet itself is not even a ball. Because of its velocity, Earth has a slight bulge at the [[Equator]]. Other than that, Earth is shaped more like a pear than an actual sphere.  All places on Earth are made of, or are on top of, rocks. The outside of the Earth is usually not uncovered rock. Over 70[[percent|%]] of the Earth is covered by [[ocean|sea]]s full of [[salt]]y water.<ref name="Physical-Hydro">{{cite web|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/8a.html|title=Chapter 8: Introduction to the Hydrosphere|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=Physical Geography}}</ref> This salty water makes up about 97{{Frac|2}}[[percent|%]] of all Earth's water. The [[fresh water]] people can drink is mostly [[ice]]. Only a very small amount is in [[river]]s and under the Earth for people to drink and use.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=World water resources and their uses|url=http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/db/shiklomanov/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010720061344/http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/db/shiklomanov/|archive-date=July 20, 2001|accessdate=2009-08-06|website=|publisher=UNESCO}}</ref> The air above the Earth stops the water from going away into [[outer space]]. Also, much of the land on Earth is covered with plants, or with what is left from earlier living things. Places with very little rain are dry wastes called [[desert]]s. Deserts usually have few living things, but life is able to grow very quickly when these wastes have rainfall. Places with large amounts of rain may be [[rain forest|large woods]]. Lately, people have changed the [[environment]] of the Earth a great deal.  === Air === {{Life timeline}} {{main|Atmosphere}} All around the Earth is a large amount of air (the [[atmosphere]]). The mass of the Earth pulls the [[gas]]ses in the air down and does not let them go into outer space. The air is mostly made of [[nitrogen]] (about 78[[percent|%]]) and [[oxygen]] (about 21[[percent|%]]) but there are a few other gasses as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/912_liftoff_atm.html|title=NASA - Earth's atmosphere|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=NASA}}</ref> Most living things need the air (or parts of the air gripped in the water) to breathe and live. They use the gasses&mdash;especially [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]&mdash;to make and use [[sugar]] and to give themselves power.  The air animals and plants use to live is only the first level of the air around the Earth (the [[troposphere]]). The day to day changes in this level of air are named [[weather]]; the changes between places far away from each other and from year to year are named the [[climate]]. [[Rain]] and [[storm]]s are both in this level. Both come about because this part of the air gets colder as it goes up. [[convection|Cold air becomes thicker and falls, and warm air becomes thinner and goes up]].<ref name="NASA">{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=What causes weather?|url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/weather_worldbook.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050501070321/http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/weather_worldbook.html|archive-date=May 1, 2005|accessdate=2009-08-06|website=|publisher=NASA}}</ref> The turning Earth moves the air as well and air moves north and south because the middle of the Earth generally gets more power from the Sun and is warmer than the north and south points. At the same time, air over water (specially very warm water) [[evaporation|gets water in it]] but, because cold air is not able to take in as much water, it starts to make [[cloud]]s and [[rain]] as it gets colder. The way water moves around in a circle like this is called the [[water cycle]].<ref name= NASA />  Above this first level, there are four other levels. The air gets colder as it goes up in the first level; in the second level (the [[stratosphere]]), the air gets warmer as it goes up. This level has a special kind of [[oxygen]] called [[ozone]]. The [[ozone]] in this air keeps living things safe from [[ultraviolet radiation|damaging rays from the Sun]]. The power from these rays is what makes this level warmer and warmer. The middle level (the [[mesosphere]]) gets colder and colder with height; the fourth level (the [[thermosphere]]) gets warmer and warmer; and the last level (the [[exosphere]]) is almost outer space and has very little air at all. It reaches about half the way to the Moon. The three outer levels have a lot of [[electricity|electric power]] moving through them; this is called the [[ionosphere]] and is important for [[radio]] and other electric waves in the air. It is also where the [[Northern Lights]] are.  Even though air seems very light, the weight of all of the air above the outside of the Earth ([[air pressure]]) is important. Generally, from [[sea level]] to the top of [[exosphere|the outer level of the air]], a space of air one [[square centimeter|cm<sup>2</sup>]] across has a mass of about 1.03 [[kilogram|kg]] and a space of air one [[square inch|sq in]] across has a weight of about 14.7 [[Pound (mass)|lb]]. The mass of the air also keeps the Earth safe when rocks ([[meteorite]]s) hit it from outer space. Without the air, the damage meteorites do would be much greater. Because of the air, meteorites generally burn up long before they get to the earth.  The air also keeps the Earth warm, specially the half turned away from the Sun. Some gasses &ndash; especially [[methane]] and [[carbon dioxide]] &ndash; [[greenhouse effect|work like a blanket to keep things warm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7h.html|title=Fundamentals of physical geography - the greenhouse effect|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=Physical Geography}}</ref> [[#History|In the past]], the Earth has been much warmer and much colder than it is now. Since people have grown used to the heat we have now, though, we do not want the Earth to be too much warmer or colder. Most of the ways people create [[electricity|electric power]] use burning kinds of [[carbon]]&mdash;especially [[coal]], [[oil]], and [[natural gas]]. Burning these creates new [[carbon dioxide]] and can cause more warming. A [[climate change|large discussion]] is going on now about what people should do about [[global warming|the Earth's latest warming]], which has gone on for about 150 years. So far, this warming has been good for people{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}<!-- Be careful -->: plants have grown better and the weather has been better than [[Little Ice Age|when it was colder before]].

The five countries with the most people are [[China]], [[India]], the [[United States]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Brazil]]. About 90% of people live in the [[northern hemisphere|north half]] of the world, which has most of the land. [[Scientist]]s think that people originally came from [[Africa]].

When there was enough food, they were able to build towns and cities. Near these places, men and women were able to change rivers, [[irrigation|bring water to farms]], and stop [[flood]]s (rising water) from coming over their land.
