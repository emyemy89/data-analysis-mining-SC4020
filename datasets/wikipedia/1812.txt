<title>EBay</title><text>{{DISPLAYTITLE:eBay}} [[Image:eBay logo.svg|right|250px]] '''eBay''' is a [[website]]. It is a place for [[online]] [[auction]]s. Anybody can [[sales|sell]] almost anything they want there. People can [[buy]] many things there as well.  People have to send what they sell themselves, usually using [[mail]]. Some items may be collected by the buyer such as items to large or heavy to post. Buyers can [[:wikt:transfer|transfer]] the [[money]] in any way they want as long as the sellers accept payments made that way. A lot of people use [[PayPal]] to transfer the money. PayPal is [[:wikt:own|owned]] by the same people as eBay. [[Margaret Whitman]] was the CEO of eBay from 1998 to 2008.  == History == eBay was started in [[1995]] by [[Pierre Omidyar]]. It was first called ''Auctionweb''. The name 'eBay' came later when he tried to register a [[domain name]] for his planned name ''EchoBay''. It was already taken so he shortened the name to 'eBay'.  == Statistics == Millions of items are bought on eBay every day. It is often very cheap to list an item on eBay. Total costs are usually below ordinary auction house costs. Many people look at others' items because they are interested in them.  == Other websites == * [http://www.ebay.com eBay site] * [http://www.howtoonebay.com/ eBay Resource Guide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310201212/http://www.howtoonebay.com/ |date=2007-03-10 }} * [http://www.most-watched.com/ Most watched items on eBay]   {{tech-stub}} {{authority control}} [[Category:Websites]]</text>
