<title>Slavery</title><text>[[File:Punishing Slaves in Cuba.tif|thumb|[[Black people|Black]] slaves in [[Cuba]] being [[Torture|tortured]] during the [[19th century]]]] '''Slavery''' is when a person is treated as the [[property]] of another person. This person is usually called a slave, with the owner being called a slavemaster. It often means that slaves are forced to work, or else they will be punished by the [[law]] (if slavery is legal in that place) or by their master.

Slavery can be traced back to the earliest records, such as the ''[[Code of Hammurabi]]'' (c. 1760&nbsp;BC).

This was seen by the [[law]]s in the [[Bible]] book of  [[Deuteronomy]] as a legal form of slavery. But the [[Israelites]] were not allowed to enslave other Israelites. The Deuteronomic Code calls for the [[death penalty]] for the [[crime]] of [[kidnapping]] Israelites to enslave them.  In [[Ancient Egypt]], slaves were mainly [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. Other ways people could become slaves was by [[Inheritance|inheriting]] the status from their parents who were slaves. Someone could become a slave if he could not pay his [[debt]]s. People also sold themselves into slavery because they were poor [[peasant]]s and needed [[food]] and [[shelter]]. The lives of slaves were normally better than that of peasants.<ref name="touregypt1">{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/slaves.htm |title=Slaves and Slavery in Ancient Egypt |publisher=Touregypt.net |date=2011-10-24 |accessdate=2015-10-18}}</ref> Young slaves could not be put to hard work, and had to be brought up by the mistress of the [[household]]. Not all slaves went to houses. Some also sold themselves to [[temple]]s, or were assigned to temples by the [[king]]. Slave trading was not very popular until later in Ancient Egypt. Afterwards, slave trades sprang up all over Egypt.  In many places, [[citizen]]<nowiki/>s were partly or fully protected from being enslaved, so most slaves were foreigners.  == Slavery in ancient Rome == [[File:Adamo Ghisi - Alegorija ropstva, 1573.jpg|thumb|Adamo Ghisi: Allegory of Slavery, etching, 1573.]] Slaves were important in [[society]] and the economy of ancient Rome. They did simple manual labor and [[Domestic worker|domestic services]], but also could have complex jobs and [[profession]]s. [[Teacher]]s, [[accountant]]s, and [[physician]]s were often slaves. [[Greece|Greek]] slaves were often [[Education|highly educated]]. Most slaves, like those sentenced to slavery as [[punishment]], worked on [[farm]]s, in [[Mining|mine]]s, and at [[mill (grinding)|mill]]s. Their living conditions were brutal, and their lives short.  Slaves were considered property under [[Roman law]] and had no legal personhood. Unlike Roman [[Citizenship|citizens]], they could suffer corporal punishment, [[Sexual abuse|sexual exploitation]] ([[Sex work|sex workers]] were often slaves), [[torture]], and [[Execution|summary execution]] legally. Slave's words could not be accepted in a court of law unless the slave was tortureda practice based on the belief that slaves would be too loyal to their masters reveal damaging evidence unless coerced. Over time, however, slaves gained some legal protection, including the right to file complaints against their masters. Attitudes changed in part because of the influence among the educated elite of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], whose [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] views of humanity extended to slaves, and because of slave [[Rebellion|rebellions]].  Roman slaves could hold [[property]] which, even though it belonged to their [[wikt:master|master]]s, they were allowed to use as if it were their own. Upper class slaves were allowed to earn their own [[money]]. With enough money they could buy their freedom.<ref>Dennis P.

While the later Atlantic slave trade concentrated on men for labor, the Arab slave trade started with men and boys, but shifted over time to concentrate more on woman and young girls for [[sex]]ual purposes.

But the mines and fields of the colonies needed more and more slaves. In the early 16th century Spain began to issue [[license]]s and [[contract]]s to supply slaves.

Today, slaves may work because of things like a high [[debt]] (for example, slaves have to work to pay off a debt). Many victims are told that their families will be harmed if they report the slave owners. Many slaves are forced to be domestic servants. In some cases, their families sell them to the slave owners. Some slaves have been trafficked from one part of the world to another. These people are illegally in their host country, and therefore do not report the abuse. Forced [[prostitution]] is a type of slavery. Another form of slavery still happening today is forced [[child labor]]. Some children have to work in [[Mining|mines]] or in [[plantation]]s, or they have to fight wars as [[child soldier]]s, for no pay.

First they abolished the [[slave trade]] so more people wouldn't become slaves. In 1833, the [[British Empire]] stopped slavery. Several other countries followed. In the [[United States]], disagreement over slavery led to the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. In 1865, when the North won, all slaves were made free. Still more countries abolished slavery afterwards. [[Pedro II of Brazil]] abolished it in 1888. Forced labor however continued, either against the law or by debt [[peon]]age or other methods which the laws of the various countries did not count as slavery.
