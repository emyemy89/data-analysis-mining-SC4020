<title>List of endangered languages</title><text>A '''list of endangered languages''' (with fewer than 1000 speakers or with very fast decline).  In order to judge if a language is actually endangered, the number of speakers is less important than the distribution among age cohorts. There may be 200,000 [[mother tongue]] speakers of the Breton language over 50 years of age, but fewer than 2,000 under 25 years of age - thus it is likely Breton will die out in the next half century. On the other hand, while there are 30,000 Ladin language speakers left, almost all children still learn it as their mother tongue - thus Ladin is not endangered in the 21st century.  : ''This page should include a link to the language's page, geographical localization and an approximate number of speakers''  == Americas == * [[Michif]], spoken by fewer than 1,000 people in western [[Canada]] * indigenous languages of Canada: ** [[Abenaki language|Abenaki]], 10 speakers ** [[Beaver language|Beaver]], 300 speakers ** [[Cayuga language|Cayuga]], 360 speakers ** Delaware ([[Munsee language|Munsee]]), fewer than 10 speakers ** [[Han language of Canada|Han]], few speakers ** [[Hare language|Hare]], 600 speakers ** [[Onandaga language|Onandaga]], fewer than 100 speakers ** [[Oneida langauge|Oneida]], 200 speakers ** [[Potawatomi language|Potawatomi]], 100 speakers ** [[Sarcee language|Sarcee]], 10 speakers ** [[Seneca language|Seneca]], 25 speakers * indigenous languages of the USA: ** Hawaiian language, Hawaii  == Asia == * [[Ainu language|Ainu]], Northern [[Japan]], 15 speakers * [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Lebanon]], [[Kurdistan]] * [[Chukchi]], [[Siberia]], circa 10,400 speakers (2001) * [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]], various parts of [[Russia]] * [[Northern indigenous peoples of Russia]] * [[Beechistani]] ,Somewhere in Northern India(Beechistaan), 6 speakers *Sanskrit, Nepal-India, Less than 500 speakers, According to Indian history, Sanskrit is the mother of all Indo-European languages. *Athpahariya language, Athpahariya *Bahing language, Bahing *Barm language, Barm *Chepang language *Kumle language, Kumle *Kusunda language, Kusunda *Surel language, Surel  == Australia == * all aboriginal languages  == Europe == * European Union **[[Alsatian language|Alsatian]] ([[France]]) very fast decline ** [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] ([[Spain]]) very fast decline ** [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] ([[Greece]]) very fast decline ** [[Basque language|Basque]] ([[Spain]] and [[France]]) very fast decline ** [[Breton language|Breton]] ([[France]]) very fast decline ** [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ([[France]]) very fast decline ** [[Corsican language|Corsican]] ([[France]]) very fast decline ** [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ([[Spain|Italy]]) very fast decline ** [[Greek language|South Italian Greek]] ([[Italy]]) very fast decline ** [[Italkian]] (Judeo-Italian) ([[Italy]]) probably extinct ** [[Molise Slavic language|Molise Slavic]] ([[Italy]]) very fast decline ** [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ([[France]]) very fast decline ** [[Sami languages]], ([[Scandinavia]]), some having fewer than 100 speakers ** [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] ([[United Kingdom]]) very fast decline ** [[Lower Sorbian language|Lower Sorbian]], ([[Germany]]) very fast decline ** [[West Flemish]] ([[France]]) very fast decline ** [[Yevanic]] (Judeo-Greek) ([[Greece]]) probably extinct * Outside of the European Union ** [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], very low usage in [[Belarus]] ** [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]], [[Istria]] [[Croatia]], 500 speakers ** [[Krimchak language|Krimchak]] (Judeo-Crimean Tatar) ** [[Livonian language|Livonian]], [[Estonia]], 35 speakers ** Mordvin ([[Russia]]), steady decline *** [[Erzya language]] *** [[Moksha language]] ** [[Votian]], [[Russia]], 50 speakers  ==Related pages== * [[endangered language]] * [[list of extinct languages]] * [[Language families and languages]] * [[Language policy]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  == Other websites == * [http://www.tooyoo.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/Redbook/index.html UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages]  {{DEFAULTSORT:endangered languages, List of}} [[Category:Language-related lists]] [[Category:Africa]]</text>
