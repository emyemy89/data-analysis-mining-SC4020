The way numbers are written and spoken differs between American English and other forms of English, such as British English and Australian English, as follows.  == American English ==  To write a whole number from 100 to 999 in American English: *  First write how many hundreds. *  Then write the word "hundred". *  Then write the name of the two-digit number after the digit in the hundreds place.  In standard, written, American English, the word "and" is ''not'' in the word-name of any whole number even though many speakers insert it.  Examples:  * 101: one hundred one * 102: one hundred two * 175: one hundred seventy-five * 200: two hundred * 300: three hundred * 512: five hundred twelve * 987: nine hundred eighty-seven  == British and Commonwealth English ==  To write a whole number from 100 to 999 in British and Commonwealth English: *  First write how many hundreds. *  Then write the words "hundred and". *  Then write the name of the two-digit number after the digit in the hundreds place.  In standard, written, British English (and the English spoken in many other places), the word "and" ''is'' in the word-name of many whole numbers.  Examples:  * 101: one hundred and one (NOT: one hundred one) * 102: one hundred and two (NOT: one hundred two) * 175: one hundred and seventy-five (NOT: one hundred seventy-five) * 200: two hundred * 300: three hundred * 512: five hundred and twelve (NOT: five hundred twelve) * 987: nine hundred and eighty-seven (NOT: nine hundred eighty-seven)  ==Related pages== * [[Names of ordinal numbers in English]] * [[Names for large numbers]] * [[Names for small numbers]]  [[Category:Numbers]]</text>
