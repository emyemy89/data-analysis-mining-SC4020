It contains the word KAROLVS.]] A '''[[signature]]''' is a special way that people write their name to let others know that they understand or approve of something that was written. A signature is often used to sign a [[contract]], a [[cheque]], or a [[petition]].  There are many ways to write a signature, and signatures may look different depending on your location. In the United States, many people have a signature which is made from writing their name in their own handwriting, often in [[cursive]]. Some signatures may be written in a different style than normal writing, which may make it difficult to read. Some people practice [[autograph]]s, or fancy signatures that are hard to copy.    Hundreds of years ago some people used sealing wax to make a copy of their [[Seal (device)|signet rings]] next to or instead of a signature. This was called their "seal. This is where the term "seal of approval" comes from. Some formal documents still use an official wax seal, such as a [[coat of arms]].   {{stub}} [[Category:Writing]] [[Category:Authentication methods]]</text>
