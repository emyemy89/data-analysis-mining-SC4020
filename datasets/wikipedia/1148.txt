<title>Milk</title><text>[[File:Milk glass.jpg|A glass of milk|thumb]] '''Milk''' is a [[white]] [[liquid]] made by [[mammal]]s, like [[cow]]s, [[dog]]s, and [[human]]s. It is made in the [[mammary gland]]s (breasts, udders, or teats) of [[female]] [[mammal]]s. Because newborn babies have no [[teeth]], they must be given milk before they can eat solid food. Milk has many [[nutrient]]s to help babies grow and be healthy. It is also a rich source of calcium which is good for your bones and teeth.  == Storing milk == If milk is not kept cold in a [[refrigerator]], it will become [[wikt:sour|sour]] after some time. When milk is warmed, it turns sour.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://imqh.com/sour-milk-recipes/  |title=Sour Milk Recipes |work=imqh.com |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> [[Fermentation]] makes this happen. [[Pediococcus|Lactic acid bacteria]] change the milk sugar into [[lactic acid]]. Fermentation is used when making [[dairy product]]s.   Milk is often [[pasteurisation|pasteurised]] before humans drink it. It is made into dairy products like [[cream]], [[butter]], [[yoghurt]], [[ice cream]], or [[cheese]]. Pasteurised cows' milk will turn sour if it is not kept in a [[refrigerator]]. Milk should be stored between 1 and 4 [[Celsius]]. If milk is treated with very high temperatures, it will last longer before spoiling. This means it does not have to be put in the refrigerator until it is opened.  == Lactose == Milk contains a chemical called [[lactose]]. Babies make an [[enzyme]] called [[lactase]] inside their bodies. Adults make less lactase. If they do not have enough, they may not be able to digest lactose anymore. This problem is called [[lactose intolerance]] and it affects many adults. There are many medicines that help adults digest lactose. Many lactose-intolerant people drink [[soy milk]] instead of animal milk, because it does not contain lactose. Soy milk tastes similar to animal milk, but it is chemically very different and is made from [[soy bean|soybeans]].  == Goat milk == Goat's milk is the milk from a [[goat]]. It can be drunk, both by humans or baby goats, or cheese can be made from it. This cheese is called [[goat's milk cheese]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.goat-milk-powder.com/Category/70/Fresh-goat-milk.aspx |title=CBM - Fresh goat milk - fresh goat milk from CBM |work=goat-milk-powder.com |accessdate=29 April 2010 |archive-date=24 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424174241/http://www.goat-milk-powder.com/Category/70/Fresh-goat-milk.aspx |url-status=dead }}</ref>  == Coconut milk == [[Coconut milk]] is not real milk because it comes from a plant instead of an animal. However, it looks similar to real milk because it is white. It also does not have as many nutrients as real milk. It is made by removing the white "meat" from a [[coconut]], pressing or squeezing the "meat", then adding water. It is sometimes used in [[cooking]], for example, in [[Thai food|Thai]] [[curry]]. Coconut cream is a thicker version of coconut milk which contains added sugar.  == Nutrients == Milk forms an important part of a person's daily balanced diet. It contains a lot of [[calcium]] that helps bones and teeth to grow stronger. Also, milk provides the body with high quality [[protein]]s, and helps in meeting the body's requirement for vitamins. One glass of milk gives about 44% to the recommended daily vitamins intake. Some kind of milks, though, do not have good calcium. These kind of milk products include [[cream]], [[cottage]] [[cheese]], ricotta cheese, and [[cream cheese]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Milk_the_facts_and_fallacies |title=Milk - facts and fallacies - Better Health Channel. |work=betterhealth.vic.gov.au |accessdate=29 April 2010 }}</ref>  == References == {{sisterlinks}} {{reflist}}  [[Category:Basic English 850 words]] [[Category:Milk| ]] [[Category:Symbols of Oklahoma]]</text>
