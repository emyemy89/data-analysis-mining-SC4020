<title>Wikipedia:Administrators</title><text>{{pp-semi|small=yes}} :''"WP:A" redirects here. You may be looking for [[Wikipedia:Announcements]]'' {{shortcut|WP:ADMIN|WP:SYSOP|WP:A|WP:MOP}} [[File:Wikipedia Administrator.svg|thumbnail|This is the symbol of a Wikipedia administrator. It shows the site's logo with a [[mop]], as administrators are often linked to [[janitor]]s.]] '''Administrators''', also called '''admins''' or '''sysops''' ('''sys'''tem '''op'''erators), are users who can use special [[Special:ListGroupRights/Admin|tools]] that help keep [[Wikipedia]] running well.  They can use these tools because they are trusted by the community, but this does not make them better or more important than anybody else.  The opinion of an administrator, for example, should not be counted as more important than the opinion of a person who chooses to change Wikipedia with an IP address just because they have administrator rights.  ''There are currently {{NUMBEROFADMINS}} administrators.''  === Administrative tools === ==== Delete ==== They can [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|delete]] and undelete pages. Pages can be deleted because of a [[WP:RFD|request for deletion]] or they can be [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Quick deletion|quickly deleted]] under policy. Undeletion requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion]].  =====Revision Delete===== Administrators can also hide [[Help:Diff|revisions]] of a page from public view by deleting them. Only other administrators can see the deleted revisions. Revisions should only be hidden in special cases, listed [[Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Revision deletion|here]].  ==== Protect ==== They can [[Wikipedia:Protection policy|protect]], unprotect and change protected pages, including those in the [[:en:Wikipedia:MediaWiki namespace|MediaWiki namespace]], and other users' personal [[Javascript]] or [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] (.js or .css) files. * Requests for protection can be made at [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard]]. Please remember that pages are usually protected when there is [[WP:VAND|vandalism]] or an [[WP:edit war|edit war]] happening, and not to prevent vandalism that has not happened.  ==== Block ==== Administrators can [[Wikipedia:Blocks and bans|block]] and unblock users who are causing trouble.  * Requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress]] but only if the user has been disruptive.  Requests made in [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|bad faith]] may result in you yourself being blocked. Blocks are different than bans.  ==== Rollback ==== They can [[Wikipedia:Rollback|rollback changes]]. This lets them quickly undo all the changes by a user to a page if they are the newest changes. The change is automatically marked as a [[Help:small change|small change]] and gives the following [[WP:Change summary|change summary]]:  :'''m''' [[Help:Revert_a_page|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/User A|User A]] ([[User_talk:User A|talk]]) to last version by User B  To use bot rollback, you type in the URL <nowiki>http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=Example&bot=1  </nowiki> replacing Example with the user name, and then you can rollback changes and hide them from the recent changes along with the rolled back edit, but this should only be used for large amounts of vandalism, like with a [[:m:vandalbot|vandalbot]]. * Users can also be given the rollback tool. You can make requests at [[WP:RFRB|requests for rollback]].  ==== Import pages ==== They can [[meta:Import|import]] pages from other Wikipedias.  ==== View unwatched pages ==== They can see which pages are not on anyone's watchlist.  ==== Manage userrights ==== They can give some user rights to others. They can add or remove rollback, IP block exempt, flooder, the uploader right, and the patroller right for all accounts.  == Bureaucrats == {{shortcut|WP:CRAT|WP:BUR}} '''Bureaucrats''' can do a few more things than an administrator, but they should only use these while acting on [[WP:CON|consensus]]. Bureaucrats can give administrator or bureaucrat rights to other users, following a successful request on [[Wikipedia:Requests for permissions]]. On the Simple English Wikipedia, bureaucrats can also remove administrator status following a successful request for removal of rights (deadminship), or in certain emergency situations for protection of the wiki. They can also "flag" and un-flag [[Wikipedia:Bot|bots]], which means to hide their contributions from the new changes and put them in the bot group.  Bureaucrats were previously able to help users who want to [[:meta:Changing username|change their username]]. These requests were handled on [[Wikipedia:Changing username]]. However, the ability to rename users has been removed from bureaucrats for [[:m:SUL finalization|SUL finalization]]. Now, these requests should be made at [[:m:SRUC|Meta-Wiki]] or on this [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|special page]] where stewards and global renamers will handle them.  == CheckUsers == {{shortcut|WP:CHECKUSER|WP:CHK|WP:CHECK}} A select few administrators are also '''CheckUsers'''. Users with CheckUser access can see the [[IP address]]es of named editors. They can also see which users edit from certain IP addresses, as well as some information on the [[browser]] used for editing. There are many rules as to who can become a CheckUser, and how CheckUsers have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:CheckUser policy|CheckUser policy]] page. CheckUsers can help fight [[vandalism]] and [[WP:Sock puppetry|sock puppetry]] this way. CheckUser requests can be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser]].  == Oversighters == Certain administrators are also '''Oversighters'''. Page [[:en:Help:Diff|revisions]] can be hidden or removed from the public history so they can only be seen by other oversighters, [[m:Stewards|stewards]], and [[:m:System administrators|developers]]; users with oversight access can hide revisions so that only these users can see them. The right is a sensitive one, and removes private data that can cause legal problems. There are many rules as to who can become an oversighter, and how oversighters have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:Oversight|Oversighter policy]] page. Oversighters can help fight [[wp:VAN|vandalism]] this way. Oversighter requests should only be made privately, and not on Wikipedia. See the [[WP:OS|Oversighter]] page.  == List of administrators == :''An automated list of accounts with administrator rights is available at [[Special:ListAdmins]].''  {| style=background:transparent
