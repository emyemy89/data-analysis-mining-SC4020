<title>Xenon</title><text>[[File:XeTube.jpg|thumbnail|Xenon in [[Geissler tube|shaped Geissler tubes]].]]  '''Xenon''' is a [[non-metal]] [[chemical element]]. It has the chemical symbol '''Xe''' and [[atomic number]] 54. It is one of the few elements that are a [[gas]] at [[Standard temperature and pressure]].  [[Sir William Ramsay]] and [[M. W. Travers]] discovered this element in 1898. The element's name came from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''xenos'', which means 'stranger'.  Xenon belongs to the group of the [[noble gas]]es. Noble gases are very unreactive. However, in 1962, chemists have found that xenon can react with [[fluorine]] under special conditions, such as high [[pressure]] and high [[temperature]]. It is not known why xenon behaves differently under these circumstances. There are also some compounds with [[oxygen]]. The gas is not very reactive, because if fulfills the [[octet rule]]. This means that a lot of [[energy]] is needed to remove an [[electron]] from xenon. This activation energy for xenon is 1172 [[Joule|kJ]]/[[mol]]. To remove a second electron from xenon, an energy of 2046.4 kJ/mol is needed.  Known oxidation states of xenon are 0, +1, +2, +4, +6 and +8. However, the most stable form is pure xenon, or the xenon's oxidation state of 0. Xenon has 8 stable [[isotope]]s and more than 30 unstable isotopes.  Xenon gas is used in [[electron tube]]s, [[bactericidal lamp]]s, [[strobe lamp]]s, and lamps used to excite ruby lasers.   It has the atomic mass of 131.294 and is the 5th inert gas in the inner gas group  ==Related pages== * [[Periodic table]] * [[List of common elements]]  {{Periodic Table}}  {{chem-stub}} {{authority control}} [[Category:Noble gases]]</text>
