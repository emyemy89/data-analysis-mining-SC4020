<title>Lists of tropical cyclone names</title><text>{{complex|date=October 2011}} [[Tropical cyclone]]s and [[subtropical cyclone]]s are named by various warning centers to provide ease of communication between forecasters and the general public regarding forecasts, watches, and warnings. The names are intended to reduce confusion in the event of concurrent storms in the same [[Tropical cyclone basins|basin]]. Generally once storms produce sustained wind speeds of more than {{convert|33|kn|km/h mph}}, names are assigned in order from predetermined lists depending on which basin they originate. However, standards vary from basin to basin: some tropical depressions are named in the Western Pacific, while tropical cyclones must have a significant amount of [[gale]]-force winds occurring around the centre before they are named in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].  Before the formal start of naming, tropical cyclones were named after places, objects, or saints' feast days on which they occurred. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the [[Queensland Government]] Meteorologist [[Clement Wragge]], who named systems between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived in the latter part of [[World War II]] for the Western Pacific. Formal naming schemes and naming lists have subsequently been introduced and developed for the [[Pacific hurricane|Eastern, Central]], [[Typhoon|Western]] and [[South Pacific tropical cyclone|Southern Pacific]] basins, as well as the [[Australian region tropical cyclone|Australian region]], [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Indian Ocean]]. ==North Atlantic== [[File:Laura 2020-08-26 2300Z.png|thumb|180px|right|Hurricane Laura in August 2020]] Within the North Atlantic Ocean, tropical or subtropical cyclones are named by the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) when they are judged to have intensified into a tropical storm with winds of at least 65&nbsp;km/h, (40&nbsp;mph). Six lists of names are used in alphabetical order, and maintained by the World Meteorological Organization with them rotating on a yearly basis. [[List of retired Atlantic hurricane names|Significant tropical cyclones]] have their names removed from the lists with a replacement name selected at the next [[World Meteorological Organization]] Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee meeting. If all of the names on a list are used, storms are named after the letters of the Greek alphabet (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc.). Greek names, unlike the names in the regular lists, cannot be removed. If a storm ever reached the magnitude that might otherwise have led to retirement, the storm would be listed with the retired names with a footnote indicating the Greek letter would still be available for future storms.<ref name="RAIVOP">{{cite web|date=2010-07-30|title=RA IV Hurricane Operational Plan for North America, Central America and the Caribbean Hurricane Operational Plan|accessdate=2010-09-25|author=Staff Writer|work=Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|date=2010-06-01|accessdate=2010-09-25|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/TCP30_2010_OpsPlan_En.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="NHC Names">{{cite web|title=Frequently asked questions: B: Tropical Cyclone Names|work=The Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/B2.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/FINAL-REPORT-HC-28.pdf|title=RA IV Hurricane Committee Twenty-eighth Session report|author=Staff Writer|date=2006-04-04|work=Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=2010-09-24|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5szgi2O7l?url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/FINAL-REPORT-HC-28.pdf|archivedate=2010-09-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>  {| class="wikitable" |+ List of Atlantic tropical cyclone names |- !scope="col" colspan=12|[[2019 Atlantic hurricane season|2019]] |- !scope="row" rowspan=2|Names | Andrea || Barry || Chantal || Dorian || Erin || Fernand || Gabrielle || Humberto || Imelda || Jerry || Karen |- | Lorenzo || Melissa || Nestor || Olga || Pablo || Rebekah || Sebastien || Tanya || Van || Wendy || |- !scope="col" colspan=12|[[2020 Atlantic hurricane season|2020]] |- !scope="row" rowspan=2|Names | Arthur || Bertha || Cristobal || Dolly || Edouard || Fay || Gonzalo || Hanna || Isaias || Josephine || Kyle |- | Laura || Marco || Nana || Omar || Paulette || Rene || Sally || Teddy || Vicky || Wilfred || |- !scope="col" colspan=12|2021 |- !scope="row" rowspan=2|Names | Ana || Bill || Claudette || Danny || Elsa || Fred || Grace || Henri || Ida || Julian || Kate |- | Larry || Mindy || Nicholas || Odette || Peter || Rose || Sam || Teresa || Victor || Wanda || |- !scope="col" colspan=12|2022 |- !scope="row" rowspan=2|Names | Alex || Bonnie || Colin || Danielle || Earl || Fiona || Gaston || Hermine || Ian || Julia || Karl |- | Lisa || Martin || Nicole || Owen || Paula || Richard || Shary || Tobias || Virginie || Walter || |- !scope="col" colspan=12|2023 |-!scope="col" colspan=12|[[2023 Atlantic hurricane season|2023]] |- !scope="row" rowspan=2|Names | Arlene || Bret || Cindy || Don || Emily || Franklin || Gert || Harold || Idalia || Jose || Katia |- | Lee || Margot || Nigel || Ophelia || Philippe || Rina || Sean || Tammy || Vince || Whitney || |- !scope="col" colspan=12|2024 |- !scope="row" rowspan=2|Names | Alberto || Beryl || Chris || Debby || Ernesto || Francine || Gordon || Helene || Isaac || Joyce || Kirk |- | Leslie || Milton || Nadine || Oscar || Patty || Rafael || Sara || Tony || Valerie || William || |- !colspan=12|References:<ref name="ATL/EPAC TCOP">{{cite report|author=RA IV Hurricane Committee|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|chapter=9|title=Regional Association IV (North America, Central America and the Caribbean) Hurricane Operational Plan 2018|accessdate=October 31, 2018|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/RA-IV-HC-40-OperationalPlan_en.pdf|date=May 16, 2018|type=Report No. TCP-30}}</ref> |} The names used recently in (2020) will be reused again in 2026.

Tropical cyclones that become tropical storms between the coast of Americas and 140W are named by the National Hurricane Center (NHC), whilst tropical cyclones intensifying into tropical storms between 140W and 180 are named by the [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] (CPHC). Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists and a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee meeting.  ===North Pacific east of 140W=== When a tropical depression intensifies into a tropical storm to the north of the Equator between the coastline of the Americas and 140E then it will be named by the NHC. Six lists of names are maintained by the World Meteorological Organization with them rotating on a yearly basis. Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists with a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee meeting. If all of the names on a list are used, storms are then named after the letters of the Greek alphabet (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc.).

Four lists of names are maintained by the World Meteorological Organization, rotating without regard to year, with the first name for a new year being the next name in sequence that was not used the previous year. Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists, with a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee meeting.

The Japan national weather service names tropical cyclones should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 65&nbsp;km/h, (40&nbsp;mph), to the north of the equator between the [[180th meridian|180]] and [[100th meridian east|100E]]. The Philippine national weather service also assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135E and 115E and between 5E-25E even if the cyclone has had a name assigned to it by the Japanese national weather service.  ===International names=== Tropical cyclones are named from the following lists by the Japanese national weather service, once they become a tropical storm. Names are contributed by members of the [[ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee]]. Each of the 14 nations or territories submitted 10 names, which are used in alphabetical order, by the English name of the country.<ref name="JMA Names">{{cite web|title=Tropical Cyclone names|date=2009-01-21|accessdate=2010-09-24|author=Staff Writer|publisher=Japan Meteorological Agency|url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/tyname.html}}</ref><ref name="Reunion">{{cite web|year=2010|title=FAQ: B) Tropical cyclones names|accessdate=2010-06-06|author=Staff Writer|publisher=[[Meteo France]]|url=http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/La_Reunion/webcmrs9.0/anglais/faq/FAQ_Ang_B.html}}</ref> {| class="wikitable" style="width:65%;" |- !
