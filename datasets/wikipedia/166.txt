Chief of Naval Technical Training: Naval Air Station Memphis.</ref>  ==How it works== The FRES test works by counting the number of words, syllables, and sentences in the text. It then calculates the average number of words per sentence and the average number of syllables per word. The idea is that shorter words and shorter sentences are easier to read. The higher the [[score]], the easier the text is to  understand. The formula is:  :<math>206.835 - 1.015 \left( \frac{\text{total words}}{\text{total sentences}} \right) - 84.6 \left( \frac{\text{total syllables}}{\text{total words}} \right)</math><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mang.canterbury.ac.nz/writing_guide/writing/flesch.shtml |title=How to Write Plain English |first1=Rudolf |last1=Flesch |publisher=University of Canterbury |accessdate=12 July 2016 |archivedate=July 12, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712094308/http://www.mang.canterbury.ac.nz/writing_guide/writing/flesch.shtml }}</ref>  Some points of reference for the score are:<ref>{{cite web|last1=Flesch|first1=Rudolf|title=How to Write Plain English|url=http://www.mang.canterbury.ac.nz/writing_guide/writing/flesch.shtml|website=University of Canterbury|accessdate=5 February 2016|archive-date=12 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712094308/http://www.mang.canterbury.ac.nz/writing_guide/writing/flesch.shtml|url-status=dead}}</ref>  {| class="wikitable" border="1" |- !

There is no lower limit to this score. Some very complicated sentences can have negative scores.  The Flesch score is usually lower for technical documentation because the topic itself is complicated. Someone who uses the test regularly will develop a sense of a reasonable score for this type of writing. They can then aim to align with this score.  The Flesch score for this subsection is 69.  == Tools == Tools to calculate the Flesch Reading Ease include:  * [[Microsoft Word]]'s [[grammar]] check * [[Abiword]] (open source) * [[Koffice|KWord]] (open source) * [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/koRpus/index.html koRpus]<ref>{{Citation|last = michalke|first = m eik|title = koRpus: An R Package for Text Analysis|date = 2017-03-02|url = https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/koRpus/index.html|last2 = Brown|last3 = Mirisola|last4 = Brulet|last5 = Hauser|first2 = Earl|first3 = Alberto|first4 = Alexandre|first5 = Laura|accessdate = 2017-03-28}}</ref>  ==References== {{reflist}}  == Other websites ==  * [http://www.checktext.org CheckText.org] ; A website that calculates Flesch Reading Ease * Rudolf Flesch, the developer of the test, provides some background information on [http://www.mang.canterbury.ac.nz/writing_guide/writing/flesch.shtml how to write plain English] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712094308/http://www.mang.canterbury.ac.nz/writing_guide/writing/flesch.shtml |date=2016-07-12 }}. * [http://readabilityofwikipedia.com/ readabilityofwikipedia.com]: a website that calculates the score for Wikipedia  [[Category:Linguistics]] [[Category:Written communication]]</text>
