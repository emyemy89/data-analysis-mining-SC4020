<title>History</title><text>'''History''' is the [[study]] of past events. People know what happened in the past by looking at [[wikt:thing|things]] ''from'' the past including sources (like [[book]]s, [[newspaper]]s, and [[letter]]s) and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] (like [[pottery]], [[tool]]s, and human or animal remains.) [[Library|Libraries]], [[archive]]s, and [[museum]]s collect and keep these things for people to study history. A person who studies history is called a [[historian]]. A person who studies [[pre-history]] and history through things left behind by ancient cultures is called an [[archaeologist]]. A person who studies [[human race|mankind]] and [[society]] is called an [[anthropologist]]. The study of the sources and methods ''used to study and write'' history is called [[historiography]].  People can learn about the past by talking to people who remember things that happened at some point in the past. This is called [[oral history]]. For example, when people who had been [[slavery|slaves]] and [[American Civil War]] [[survivor]]s got old, some historians recorded them talking about their lives, so that history would not be lost.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About this Collection {{!}} Born in Slavery: Slave Narratives from the Federal Writers' Project, 1936-1938 {{!}} Digital Collections {{!}} Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/slave-narratives-from-the-federal-writers-project-1936-to-1938/about-this-collection/|access-date=2020-10-24|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref>   In old times people in different parts of the world kept separate histories because they did not meet each other very often. Some groups of people never met each other. The rulers of [[Medieval]] [[Europe]], [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Ancient China]] each thought that they ruled the only important parts of the world and that other parts were "[[barbarian]]". But they were still connected, even if they didn't realize it.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Silk Ties: The Links Between Ancient Rome & China {{!}} History Today|url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/silk-ties-links-between-ancient-rome-china|access-date=2020-10-24|website=www.historytoday.com}}</ref>  == Timeline of history == *[[Pre-history]] * [[Ancient history]] ** [[Sumer]] ** [[Ancient Egypt]] ** [[Babylonia]] **[[Ancient Armenia]] ** [[Ancient Greece]] ** [[Ancient India]] ** [[Ancient China]] and [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Mongolia]] ** [[Ancient Southeast Asia]] - [[Cambodia]] - [[Thailand]] - [[Indonesia]] ** [[Ancient North America]] - [[Iroquois]], [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Wyandot people|Huron]], [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Lenape]], [[Mohican]], [[Cree]], [[Sioux]], [[Inuit]], [[Dene]] ** [[Ancient Central America]] - [[Aztecs]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Olmecs]], [[Toltecs]], [[Teotihuacan]], [[Mixtecs]] ** [[Ancient South America]] - [[Inca]], [[Chimu]], [[Tihuanacu]], [[Huari]] ** [[Ancient Africa]] ** [[Ancient Australia]] * [[Roman Empire]] * [[Christian Rome]] - [[Justinian]] to the rise of [[Byzantium]] * [[Chinese Dynasties]] * [[Byzantine Empire]] * [[Early Islamic Caliphate]] - [[Muhammad]] to [[The Crusades]] * [[Early Middle Ages]] - end of European Dark Ages to rise of [[Roman Catholic Church]] * [[High Middle Ages]] and [[the Crusades]] - conflict with [[Islam]], [[Cathar]]s, [[pagan]] tribes in [[Lithuania]], etc. * [[Late Middle Ages]] - [[13th century]] to [[15th century]] * [[Late Islamic Caliphate]] - to fall of [[Muslim Spain]] * [[Mongol Empire]] * [[Renaissance]] - 15th century renewal of [[science]] etc., based on texts from Ancient Greece and Roman Empire that were preserved by Muslims and captured by Christians * [[European colonization of the Americas]] - 15th century impact on America **[[Spanish Empire]] **[[British Empire]] * [[Baroque era]] - mid [[16th century]] to mid-late [[18th century]] ** Conflict of [[Ottoman Empire]] with [[Austria-Hungary]] ** Rise of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in China * [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] - mid [[17th century]] to late [[18th century]] * [[19th century]] **[[British Empire]] * [[20th century]] **[[History of Australia]] since colonizing [[Australia]] **[[History of the United States]]  * [[Modern History]] and origins of modern [[world power structure]] **[[World War I]] ** [[World War II]] ** [[United Nations ascendance]] - how it became so central. ** [[Chinese Civil War|Chinese Revolution]], [[Partition of India]], [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) ** US-Soviet [[Cold War]] including [[Korean War]], [[Vietnam War]], [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet-Afghan War]] ** [[Recent conflicts in the Muslim World]] - [[ArabIsraeli conflict|Arab-Israeli Wars]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001present)|US invasion of Afghanistan]], [[2003 invasion of Iraq|US invasion of Iraq]] ** [[Recent conflicts in West Africa]] - [[Uganda]], [[Chad]], [[Rwanda]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Liberia]], [[Ivory Coast]], and so on  [[Current events]], [[modern economic history]], [[modern social history]] and [[modern intellectual history]] take very different views of the way history has affected the way that we think today.  == References == <references /> == Related pages == {{commonscat}}{{wikt}} * [[List of historians]] * [[World History]] * [[Political economy]] * [[Historical novel]] [[Category:Basic English 850 words]] [[Category:History| ]]   [[as:]] [[be-x-old:]]</text>
