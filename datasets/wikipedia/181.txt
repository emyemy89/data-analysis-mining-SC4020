These chefs developed a lighter style of food compared to the food of the [[Middle Ages]]. They used fewer spices, and more [[herb]]s and creamy ingredients.  Typical ingredients like [[roux]] and fish stock, and techniques such as [[marinade|marinading]], and dishes such as [[ragout]], were invented. Carme was an expert ptissier (pastry-maker), and this is still a mark of French cooking. He developed basic sauces, his 'mother sauces'; he had over a hundred sauces in his repertoire, based on the half-dozen mother sauces.  French cuisine was introduced in the 20th century by [[Auguste Escoffier|Georges Auguste Escoffier]] (18461935). He was a genius at organisation. He worked out how to run large restaurants, as in a big hotel or a palace; how the staff should be organised; how the menu was prepared. He had methods for everything. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of ''Le Guide Culinaire'' in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. Escoffier managed the restaurants and cuisine at the [[Savoy Hotel]] and [[Carlton Hotel]] in [[London]], the [[Htel Ritz Paris]], and some of the greatest cruise ships.  Escoffier, however, left out much of the culinary character to be found in the [[regions of France]].  Gastro-tourism and the ''[[Guide Michelin]]'' helped to make people familiar with the rich [[bourgeois]] and peasant cuisine of the French countryside in the 20th century. [[Gascony|Gascon]] cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have become common all over the country. [[Cheese]] and [[wine]] are a major part of the cuisine, playing different roles regionally and nationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodcooking.com/frcheese.htm|title=French Cheeses|accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.franceway.com/cheese/|title=French Cheese|accessdate=1 August 2010|archive-date=27 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827131743/http://www.franceway.com/cheese/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://trifter.com/practical-travel/world-cuisine/top-10-most-tasty-cuisines-in-the-world/|title=The world's best cuisines|accessdate=1 August 2010|archive-date=26 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726071220/http://trifter.com/practical-travel/world-cuisine/top-10-most-tasty-cuisines-in-the-world/|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the [[north]] of France, people often prefer to use [[butter]] to [[wikt:cook|cook]].
