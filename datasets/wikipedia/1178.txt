<title>Study skills</title><text>'''Study skills''' or '''study strategies''' are systematic ways to improve [[learning]]. They are needed for success in [[school]], especially for [[college]] and beyond.<ref>Dianna Van Blerkom, ''College Study Skills: Becoming a Strategic Learner'' (Boston, MA: Wadsworth/Cengage Learning, 2012), p. xxvi</ref> Study skills include numerous techniques and skills that help in acquiring and retaining information. Some are assessment tools that help a student see where they need help most.  Study skills might include a learner's ability to [[listen]], [[read]], [[understanding|understand]], [[concentrate]], [[memory|remember]] and organise their learning material, and manage studying time.   == Learning strategies ==  * [[Time management]] is an essential skill. [[Teacher]]s have found a connection between students who can manage their time well, and their [[Grading (education)|GPA]] (grade point average). The better they manage time, the higher their GPA. Britton and Tesser (1991)<ref>Bruce K. Britton; Abraham Tesser, 'Effects of time-management practices on college grades', ''Journal of Educational Psychology'', Vol 83(3) (Sep 1991), pp. 405-410</ref> found that measuring the time management skills of [[wikt:freshman|freshmen]] was a better indicator of higher GPAs than their [[SAT]] scores as [[wikt:senior|seniors]].<ref name=Dembo14>Myron H. Dembo, ''Motivation and Learning Strategies for College Success: A Self-Management '' (New York; London: Routledge, 2001), p. 14</ref> Most students find that by analyzing their use of time, much of it is wasted.<ref name=Dembo14/>  * [[Mnemonics]] may help to remember [[list]]s or [[sequence]]s of information. The name [[Roy G. Biv]] is an example of a mnemonic. It is an [[acronym]] for the [[color]]s of the [[rainbow]] in proper sequence: '''R'''ed, '''O'''range, '''Y'''ellow, '''G'''reen, '''B'''lue, '''I'''ndigo and '''V'''iolet.<ref name=Kelly81>Dianne Evans Kelley, ''Common-Sense Classroom Management for Special Education Teachers, Grades 6-12'' (Thousand Oaks, CA: Corwin Press, 2007), p. 81</ref> They also include [[rhyme]]s, [[phrase]]s, [[poem]]s and associating [[picture]]s with information.<ref name=Kelly81/> Mnemonics should be used sparingly as they have some limitations.<ref> Wong (2014) '[http://college.cengage.com/collegesurvival/wong/essential_study/6e/assets/students/protected/wong_ch06_in-depthmnemonics.html Essential Study Skills]', ''Wadsworth Cengage Learning. Accessed 7 July 2014</ref>  * The SQ3R Method. This is an acronym for survey question, read, recite and review.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.jm/node/26 |title=Study Skills |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2014 |website= |publisher=Ministry of Education, Jamaica |accessdate=6 July 2014 }}</ref> SQ3R was developed by Francis Robinson in 1941.<ref name=Columbus>{{cite web |url=http://www.cscc.edu/services/peertutoring/resources/sq3r-method.shtml |title=SQ3R Method |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2014 |website= |publisher=Columbus State Community College |accessdate=6 July 2014 }}</ref> Students learn to survey the reading materials, not by reading every word, but by getting an overall sense of what it is about. The next step is to form questions. Look at the end of [[chapter]]s or [[book]]s to see if there are questions. Read the materials to answer the questions. Next, recite what you have learned out loud. Reciting helps the learning process much better than reading alone. Review the information a few hours or even days later. This keeps it fresh in your mind.<ref name=Columbus/>  * Skimming and Scanning. Skim reading is a technique to gain the most from reading something in the least amount of time. It is looking at chapter headings, [[wikt:bullet list|bullet lists]] of key points in [[:en:wikt:sidebar|sidebars]] and key words in sentences.The first sentence of a chapter often is a [[wikt:abstract|abstract]] of the chapter.<ref name=Pennington28>Mark Pennington, ''Essential Study Skills'' (El Dorado Hills, CA: Pennington Publishing, 2009), p. 28</ref> Scanning involves moving your finger down the page as you read. The object is to try to absorb at least 50% of the text. It is then compared to what was skimmed.<ref name=Pennington28/>  * Study Groups. Colleges and universities encourage students to form study groups. A study group can divide tasks and each member concentrate on one segment. Students who teach or share what they know with others learn more.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dso.iastate.edu/sites/default/files/imported/asc/academic/handouts/study/studygroups.pdf |title=Study Skills: Study Groups |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2014 |website= |publisher=Academic Success Center, Iowa State University |accessdate=6 July 2014 |archive-date=13 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313215635/http://www.dso.iastate.edu/sites/default/files/imported/asc/academic/handouts/study/studygroups.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> A study group uses active learning, a very effective way to learn.<ref> Ph.D. Hansen, ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Study Skills'' (New York, NY: Alpha, 2008), p. 107</ref>  * Taking effective notes. Note taking skills learned in high school are rarely adequate for college. In college, good note taking involves [[critical thinking]].<ref name=Dembo218.19>Myron H. Dembo, ''Motivation and Learning Strategies for College Success: A Self-Management '' (New York; London: Routledge, 2001), pp. 21819</ref> Professors often [[lecture]] at a fast pace. Do not try to write down everything, try to establish what are key points. A good clue to key or important points is that a teacher or lecturer may repeat them during the lecture.<ref>Paige Ruschhaupt 2011. [http://www.uhv.edu/StudentSuccessCenter/study/pdf/Listening.to.Lectures.pdf Listening to lectures and identifying important information during a lecture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222065440/http://www.uhv.edu/StudentSuccessCenter/study/pdf/Listening.to.Lectures.pdf |date=2014-12-22 }}, ''University of Houston  Victoria'', Access date 7 July 2014</ref> It is important to develop good [[listening]] skills.<ref name=Dembo218.19/> Key skills to good note taking are: :* Pre-reading the materials.
