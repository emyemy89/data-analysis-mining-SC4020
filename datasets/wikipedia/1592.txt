[[Ancient history|Ancient]] [[civilization]]s began in the [[Fertile Crescent]] in the Middle East. These were [[Sumer]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Assyria]] in the area called [[Mesopotamia]], and [[Ancient Egypt]]. The three [[Abrahamic religion]]s that believe in [[Monotheism|one God]] also came from the Middle East. [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] began in ancient Israel and [[Islam]] began in [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]].  Today, the Middle East is very important because much of the [[petroleum]] that other countries use comes from here. There are also many arguments and wars, such as the conflict between [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]], the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], and the [[Syrian civil war]].  == Related pages == {{commons|Middle East}}  * [[Central Asia]] * [[East Asia]] * [[South Asia]] * [[Southeast Asia]]  {{Middle East}}  {{geo-stub}}  [[Category:Middle East| ]]</text>
