It described the planet [[Earth]] as having a [[cube|cubic]] [[symmetry]], and [[time]] as rotating four "corners". He also said that all of modern [[physics]] is wrong. Scientists reject these ideas, saying that they make no sense and cannot be [[test]]ed.  The Time Cube website was written in an angry and hateful voice. On his site, Ray said that not believing in Time Cube would be "stupid and evil". Some of the comments were [[racism|racist]] and discriminatory, especially against black people and [[Judaism|Jews]]. There were also many comments against [[homosexuality|gay]] people. Many people found the site to be difficult to understand.   Ray spoke about Time Cube at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in January 2002.<ref name="mit"/> At MIT, a professor tried to cancel the lecture before it took place. Ray believed this is proof of a [[conspiracy]] to keep information about Time Cube hidden. Ray also spoke about Time Cube at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in April 2005.<ref name=Technique>[https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/1853/7877/3/focus-2005-04-22.pdf "Oddball Time Cube theorist piques interest, elicits mixed response"], by Joshua Cuneo, ''[[The Technique]]''.
