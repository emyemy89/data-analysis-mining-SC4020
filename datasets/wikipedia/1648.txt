<title>Acid</title><text>:''The article about certain properties of [[database]]s is at [[ACID]]'' :''Sometimes acid is another name for the drug [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] (Lysergic acid diethylamide)'' [[File:Hydrochloric acid ammonia.jpg|thumb|[[Hydrochloric acid]] (in [[beaker]]) reacting with [[ammonia]] fumes to produce [[ammonium chloride]] (white smoke).]] [[File:Sulfuric acid burning tissue paper.jpg|thumb|Acids can be dangerous: The holes in the paper were made by a solution with 98% sulfuric acid.]] An '''acid''' is a substance that can donate a [[hydrogen]] [[ion]] (H<sup>+</sup>) (generally speaking, this will be a [[proton]]) to another substance. Acids have a [[pH]] less than 7.0.  A chemical can donate a proton if the hydrogen atom is attached to an electronegative atom like [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], or [[chlorine]]. Some acids are [[strong acid|strong]] and others are [[weak acid|weak]]. The weak acids hold on to some of their protons, while the strong acids let go of all of them. All acids will release hydrogen ions into solutions. The amount of ions that get released per molecule will determine if the acid is weak or strong.Weak acidsare acids that partially release the hydrogen atoms that are attached. These acids, then, may lower pH by dissociation of hydrogen ions, but not completely. Weak acids generally have a [[pH]] value of 4-6 while strong acids have a pH value of 1 to 3.  A [[Base (chemistry)|base]] is an acid's "chemical opposite." A base is a substance that will accept the acid's hydrogen atom. Bases are molecules that can  split apart in water and release hydroxide ions.  ==How acids work== Acids and bases typically exist together in [[equilibrium]]. This means that within a sample of an acid, some molecules will give up their protons and others will accept them. Even water is a mixture of an acidic ion, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> (called a hydronium ion) and a basic ion, OH<sup>-</sup> (called a hydroxide ion). A hydronium ion will give up its proton to a hydroxide ion, forming two molecules of H<sub>2</sub>O, which is neutral. This reaction happens continuously in a sample of water, but overall the sample is neutral because there are equal amounts of hydronium and hydroxide in the sample. For most reactions, however, the acids and bases are not present in equal amounts, and this imbalance is what allows a chemical reaction to occur.  Every acid has a conjugate base formed by removing the acid's proton. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), for example, is an acid and its conjugate base is a chlorine anion, or Cl<sup>-</sup>. An acid and its conjugate base are opposite in strength. Since HCl is a strong acid, Cl<sup>-</sup> is a weak base.  == Properties == [[File:Hazard C.svg|thumb|Warning picture used with dangerous acids and dangerous bases. Bases are the opposites of acids.]] Acids can have different ''strengths'', some are more reactive than others. More reactive acids are often more dangerous.  Acids can have a lot of different properties depending on their [[molecule|molecular]] structure. Most acids have the following properties:  * taste sour when they are eaten * can sting the skin when they are touched * can [[corrosion|corrode]] (or eat away at) metals and skin * can be used as a [[reactant]] during [[electrolysis]] due to the presence of mobile ions * turn blue [[litmus paper]] red * turn red or orange on [[universal indicator]] * conduct electricity Acids can burn the skin, the severity of the burn depending on the type and concentration of the acid. These chemical burns require immediate medical attention.  Because acids donate hydrogen ions, all acids must have hydrogen in them.  == Importance == Acids are important. [[Nucleic acid]]s, such as [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] contain the [[genetic code]]. These [[molecule]]s determine many characteristics of an organism, they are passed from the parents to offspring. DNA contains the plans how to build [[protein]]s which are made of [[amino acid]]s.  [[Fatty acid]]s and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology. These contain long chains of [[hydrocarbon]]s and a [[carboxylic acid]] group on one end. The [[cell membrane]] of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a [[phospholipid bilayer]], a [[micelle]] of hydrophobic fatty acid chains with polar, hydrophilic [[phosphate]] "head" groups.  In humans and many other animals, [[hydrochloric acid]] is a part of the [[gastric acid]] secreted within the [[stomach]]. It can help hydrolyze [[protein]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s. It can also convert the inactive pro-enzyme, [[pepsinogen]] into the [[digestive enzyme|enzyme]], [[pepsin]]. Some organisms produce acids for defense; for example, [[ant]]s produce [[formic acid]], and octopi produce a black acid called magneta.  Most acids can be found in nature. Some of these include the following: * [[Vinegar]] is probably one of the best known; it contains [[acetic acid]], which gives it its well known flavor. * [[Nitric acid]], NHO<sub>3</sub> is known since about the [[13th century]]. * [[Citric acid]]s, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub> can be found in many kinds of [[fruit]]. They were probably discovered by [[Geber]] in the 8th century.<ref name="geber1">[http://www.islamicspain.tv/Arts-and-Science/The-Culture-of-Al-Andalus/Chemistry.htm Chemistry<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="geber2">{{Cite web |url=http://muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/?p=1553 |title=Muslim Scientists and Thinkers: Abu Musa Jabir bin Hayyan : The Muslim Observer<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2009-10-21 |archive-date=2009-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115205940/http://muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/?p=1553 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="geber3">[http://journals.iucr.org/a/issues/2008/01/00/sc5012/index.html (IUCr) On wine, chirality and crystallography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> * [[Lactic acid]], C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was found by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] in 1780.
