<title>Native American</title><text>[[File:Edward S. Curtis Collection People 013.jpg|right|200px|Portrait of a Native American]]  '''Native Americans''' (also called '''Aboriginal Americans''', '''American Indians''', '''Amerindians''' or '''indigenous peoples of America''') are the people and their descendants, who were in the [[Americas]] when Europeans arrived.  There are many different [[tribe]]s of Native American people, with many different languages.  There are more than three million Native Americans in Canada and the U.S. combined.  About 51 million Native Americans live in [[Latin America]].  Sometimes these people are called '''Indians''', but this may be confusing, because it is the same word used for people from [[India]]. When [[Christopher Columbus]] explored, he did not know about the [[Americas]]. He was in the [[Caribbean]] but thought he was in the [[East Indies]], so he called the people '''Indians'''.   Many Native Americans died after the Europeans came to the Americas. There were [[disease]]s that came with the Europeans but were new to the Native Americans. There were [[battle]]s with the Europeans. Many native people were hurt, killed, or forced to leave their homes by settlers who took their lands.  Some Native Americans kept [[jaguar]]s as pets.  Native Americans introduced [[vanilla]] and [[chocolate]] to the world.  == Origins == The ancestors of Native Americans came to the Americas from [[Asia]]. Some of them may have come to America 15,000 years ago when [[Alaska]] was connected to [[Siberia]] by the [[Bering land bridge]].  The earliest people in the Americas came from [[Siberia]] when there was an ice bridge across the [[Bering Strait]]. The cold but mainly grassy plain which connected Siberia with Canada is called [[Beringia]].  It is reckoned that a few thousand people arrived in  Beringia from eastern Siberia during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] before moving into the Americas sometime after 16,500 years before the present (BP).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170328-the-first-people-who-populated-the-americas|title=The first people who populated the Americas}}</ref> This would have occurred as the American glaciers blocking the way southward melted,<ref name="autogenerated2007">{{cite journal | last = Wang | first = Sijia |display-authors = etal | year = 2007 | title = Genetic variation and population structure in Native Americans | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = e185 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030185 | pmid = 18039031 | pmc = 2082466 }}</ref><ref name="Goebel_2008">{{cite journal | last = Goebel | first = Ted |author2=Waters, Michael R. |author3=O'Rourke, Dennis H. | year = 2008 | title = The Late Pleistocene dispersal of modern humans in the Americas | journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5869 | pages = 14971502 | doi = 10.1126/science.1153569 | pmid = 18339930 |bibcode = 2008Sci...319.1497G | citeseerx = 10.1.1.398.9315 }}</ref><ref name="Fagundes_2008">{{cite journal | last = Fagundes | first = Nelson J.R. | year = 2008 | title = Mitochondrial population genomics supports a single pre-Clovis origin with a coastal route for the peopling of the Americas | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 82 | issue = 3 | pages = 583592 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.11.013 | pmid = 18313026 | pmc = 2427228 |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name="Tamm_2007">{{cite journal | last = Tamm | first = Erika | year = 2007 | title = Beringian standstill and spread of Native American founders | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 9 | pages = e829 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000829 | pmid = 17786201 | pmc = 1952074 | editor1-last = Carter | editor1-first = Dee |bibcode = 2007PLoSO...2..829T |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Achilli | first = A. | year = 2008 | title = The phylogeny of the four Pan-American MtDNA haplogroups: Implications for Evolutionary and Disease Studies | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = e1764 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0001764 | pmid = 18335039 | pmc = 2258150 | editor1-last = MacAulay | editor1-first = Vincent |bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.1764A |display-authors=etal}}</ref> but before the bridge was covered by the sea about 11,000 years BP.   Before European colonization, Beringia was inhabited by the [[Yupik peoples]] on both sides of the straits. This culture remains in the region today, with others. In 2012, the governments of [[Russia]] and the [[United States]] announced a plan to formally establish "a transboundary area of shared Beringian heritage". Among other things this agreement would establish close ties between the [[Bering Land Bridge National Preserve]] and the [[Cape Krusenstern National Monument]] in the United States and [[Beringia National Park]] in Russia.<ref>{{cite news | title=Ancient land of 'Beringia' gets protection from US, Russia | newspaper=[[NBC News]] | url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/21/13941998-ancient-land-of-beringia-gets-protection-from-us-russia?lite | author=Llanos, Miguel | date=21 September 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923070230/http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/21/13941998-ancient-land-of-beringia-gets-protection-from-us-russia?lite | archivedate=23 September 2012 }}</ref>  Native Americans are divided into many small nations, called [[First Nations]] in Canada and [[tribe]]<nowiki/>s elsewhere.  ==Today==  According to the 2010 United States census, 0.9% of Americans say they are Native American, 2.9 million people, and 1.7% of Americans say they are both Native American and something else.
