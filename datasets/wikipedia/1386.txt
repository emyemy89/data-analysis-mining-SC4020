<title>Safety lamp</title><text>[[image:Davy lamp.png|thumb|Safety lamp]] A '''safety lamp''' is a [[mining|miner]]'s [[lamp]] with a covered flame that used to be used in [[Coal mining|coal mines]].  ==Types of safety lamps== The first safety lamp was invented by [[William Reid Clanny]]. It used [[bellows]] and water to separate gasses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minerslamps.net/homepage/safetylamphistory.htm |title=Brief History of the Miner's Flame Safety Lamp |publisher=Minerslamps.net |accessdate=May 27, 2012 |archive-date=August 26, 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030826065256/http://www.minerslamps.net/homepage/safetylamphistory.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> Later, two newer designs were invented. One newer design was the [[Geordie lamp]], made by [[George Stephenson]], and the other was the [[Davy lamp]], made by [[Humphry Davy|Sir Humphry Davy]]. In 1815, Davy discovered that if a flame was in a lamp, it would not ignite the flammable gases in mines.   ==How it works== Coal mines are dangerous because of flammable gasses like [[methane]] that can accumulate (gather together). A lamp with a naked (exposed) flame might make these flammable gasses catch fire, causing an [[explosion]], which could kill people. The safety lamp prevents the hot flame of the lamp touching the flammable gasses, reducing the chance of an explosion.  == References == {{reflist}}   {{stub}}  [[Category:Safety]]</text>
