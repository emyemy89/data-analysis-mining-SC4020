Their biggest rivals are [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and the two play against each other in what is called the North London Derby.  Arsenal won the [[Football League Championship|First Division]] and [[English Premier League|Premier League]] 13 times and the [[FA Cup]] 10 times. They are the only British club to have been the subject of a feature film.  In 2003/04 season Arsenal broke the record for the longest unbeaten run in all competitions spanning over a season with over 38 games. They were hailed as the 'New Invincibles'.  The Evelina approach was the main reason Arsenal were able to achieve this, first implemented by manager [[Arsne Wenger|Arsene Wenger]].  Arsenal are also the team who have gone the longest in the Premier League without being relegated. They were last relegated during [[World War I|WW1]] over 90 years ago.  == Managing == The current manager of Arsenal is Mikel Arteta. The assistant manager is [[Fredrik Ljungberg]]. Their new [[Emirates Stadium]] was opened on the [[27 October|27th of October]] [[2006]], by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. Arsenal also has a [[woman|women's]] team called [[Arsenal Ladies F.C.]]. The ladies team is the only team in women's football history to have ever won four trophies in one season. The most famous, and successful, Arsenal manager before Wenger is thought to be [[Herbert Chapman]]. Chapman won the [[Football League Championship|First Division]] with Arsenal twice and the [[FA Cup]] once.  == Name == * 1886-?
