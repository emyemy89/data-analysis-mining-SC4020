<title>Official language</title><text>[[File:Ancient Tamil Script.jpg|thumb|right|Ancient [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscription at the [[Brihadeeswara Temple]] in [[Thanjavur]]]] An '''official language''' is a [[language]] that has special [[wikt:status|status]] in a [[country]] or other [[organization]]. Usually, the [[government]] does its [[business]] in the official language. They are sometimes named in a country's [[constitution]].  Some countries, like [[Switzerland]] and [[Luxembourg]], have more than one official language. Other countries, such as the [[United States]] and [[Australia]], may not have a ''[[de jure]]'' official language set by [[law]], but they may have one or more [[national language]]s that is considered ''[[de facto]]'' official because it is used by the government and people in the country.  An official language does not have to be a written language. It can be a [[pidgin]] language (like in [[Papua New Guinea]]), or a sign language (like in [[New Zealand]]).  == Related pages == * [[National language]] * [[Lingua franca]]  {{stub}}  [[Category:Languages]] [[Category:Vocabulary]]</text>
