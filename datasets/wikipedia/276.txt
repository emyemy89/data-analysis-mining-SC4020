<title>Leap year</title><text>A '''leap year''' is a [[year]] in which an extra [[day]] is added to the [[Gregorian calendar]], which is used by most of the world. A [[common year]] (an ordinary year) has 365 [[day]]s, but a leap year has 366 days. The extra day, February 29, is added to the [[month]] of [[February]]. In an ordinary year, February has 28 days, but in a leap year it has 29 days. The extra day, called a leap day, is the same day of the week as the first day of the month, February 1. Also, in a leap year, the months of [[January]], [[April]], and [[July]] all start on the same day of the week.  A leap year comes once every four years. Because of this, a leap year can always be evenly [[Division (mathematics)|divided]] by four. For example, 2020 was a leap year. But a year is a common year if it can be evenly divided by 100 but not by 400. This is why 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years, but not 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, or 2300.  We have leap years because instead of 365 days, the [[Earth]] really takes a few minutes less than 365-1/4 days (365.24219) to go completely around the [[Sun]]. Without leap years, the [[season]]s would start one day earlier on the calendar every four years. After 360 years, [[Spring (season)|spring]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and [[autumn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] would begin on December 21 (which is when winter in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in the Southern Hemisphere presently begins).  A number of countries use a [[lunar calendar]] (based on the [[Moon]], instead of the [[Sun]], like our [[solar calendar]] is). They have leap years when they add an extra lunar month. Different calendars add the extra month in different ways. So a year which has 366 days instead of 365 days where the month of February has 29 days is called a leap year.  ==Related pages== * [[February 29]] * [[Common year]] * [[Century leap year]]  [[Category:Years]]</text>
