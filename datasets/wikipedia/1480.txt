<title>Common year</title><text>A '''common year''' is a [[year]] that is not a [[leap year]].  In the [[Gregorian calendar]] a common year has 365 [[day]]s. This means a common year has 52 [[week]]s and one day.  So if a certain year started on a Monday, the following year will start on a Tuesday.  Stated differently, a common year always begins and ends on the same day of the week. (For example, '''2021''' (the current year), both January 1 and December 31 falls on a Friday.)   In the [[Gregorian calendar]], 303 out of every 400 years are common years. In the [[Julian calendar]], 300 out of every 400 years were common years. All the other years are special and known as [[leap year]]s.  *[[2000]], a [[leap year]], began on a [[Saturday]]. *[[2001]] began on a [[Monday]]. *[[2002]] began on a [[Tuesday]]. *[[2003]] began on a [[Wednesday]]. *[[2004]], a [[leap year]], began on a [[Thursday]]. *[[2005]] began on a [[Saturday]]. *[[2006]] began on a [[Sunday]]. *[[2007]] began on a [[Monday]]. *[[2008]], a [[leap year]], began on a [[Tuesday]]. *[[2009]] began on a [[Thursday]]. *[[2010]] began on a [[Friday]]. *[[2011]] began on a [[Saturday]]. *[[2012]], a [[leap year]], began on a [[Sunday]]. *[[2013]] began on a [[Tuesday]]. *[[2014]] began on a [[Wednesday]]. *[[2015]] began on a [[Thursday]]. *[[2016]], a [[leap year]], began on a [[Friday]]. *[[2017]] began on a [[Sunday]]. *[[2018]] began on a [[Monday]]. *[[2019]] began on a [[Tuesday]]. *[[2020]], a [[leap year]], began on a [[Wednesday]]. *[[2021]] began on a [[Friday]]. *[[2022]] will begin on a [[Saturday]]. *[[2023]] will begin on a [[Sunday]]. *[[2024]], a leap year, will begin on a [[Monday]].  == Months == These are the 12 [[month]]s in a year.  * [[January]] has 31 days. * [[February]] has 28 days. * [[March]] has 31 days. * [[April]] has 30 days. * [[May]] has 31 days. * [[June]] has 30 days. * [[July]] has 31 days. * [[August]] has 31 days. * [[September]] has 30 days. * [[October]] has 31 days. * [[November]] has 30 days. * [[December]] has 31 days.  There are 7 months with 31 days. There are 4 months with 30 days. There is 1 month with 28 days. In the [[Julian calendar]], introduced by [[Julius Caesar]] in 45 BC, every 4 years there is 29 days in February which is called a leap year. This happens because every year is 365 and 1/4 days but instead of us having a spare quarter of a day in each year we add them all up every 4 years and make an extra day to avoid confusion and make things easier for everyone. In the [[Gregorian Calendar]], which was introduced in 1582 by [[Pope Gregory XIII]], because the [[Julian calendar]] added slightly too many years, three leap years were removed for every 400 years. These are those that are multiples of 100, but not multiples of 400. Thus, in the [[Gregorian calendar]], 2020 is a leap year, but not 2019 and 2021, 1900 is not a leap year even though 1904 and 1896 are, and 2000 is a leap year even though 1900 and 2100 are not.    {{stub}}  [[Category:Years]]</text>
