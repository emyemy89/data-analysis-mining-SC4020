<title>June</title><text>{{monththisyear|6}} '''June''' is the sixth [[month]] of the [[year]], coming between [[May]] and [[July]]. It has 30 [[day]]s. In [[Sweden]] in [[1732]] the month had 31 days. June never begins on the same day of the week as any other month, but always ends on the same day of the week as [[March]].  == The Month == June comes between [[May]] and [[July]] and is the sixth month of the year in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. It is one of four months to have 30 days.  June and May are the only two months that do not begin on the same day of the week as any other month in any year. June ends on the same day of the week as [[March]] every year, as each other's last days are 13 weeks (91 days) apart.  In common years, June starts on the same day of the week as [[September]] and [[December]] of the previous year, and in leap years, [[April]] and [[July]] of the previous year. In common years, June finishes on the same day of the week as September of the previous year, and in leap years, April and December of the previous year.  Every year, June starts on the same day of the week as [[February]] of the following year, as each other's first days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart. In years immediately before common years, June starts on the same day of the week as [[March]] and [[November]] of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[August]] of the following year. In years immediately before common years, June finishes on the same day of the week as August and November of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[May]] of the following year.  June is one of two months to have a [[solstice]] (the other is [[December]], its seasonal equivalent in both [[hemisphere]]s), and in this month the [[Tropic of Cancer]] in the [[Northern hemisphere|Northern Hemisphere]] is turned towards the [[Sun]], meaning that [[June 20]] or [[June 21]] is the Northern [[Summer Solstice]] and the Southern [[Winter Solstice]]. This means that this date would have the most daylight of any day in the [[Northern hemisphere]], and the least in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. There are 24 hours of daylight at the [[North Pole]] and 24 hours of darkness at the [[South Pole]].  ==Events in June== * The [[solstice]] occurs around [[June 21]], but it may occur on either the [[June 20|20th]] or the [[June 22|22nd]].
