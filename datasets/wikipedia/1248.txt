<title>Prime minister</title><text>A '''prime minister''' manages the [[politics]] of a country and is the [[head of government]]. With [[countries]] that have [[king]]s and [[queen]]s (known as [[monarch]]s), they are very important because they are in charge of most of the politics (they are "head of the government"). In countries with a [[president]], they might be in charge of most of the politics (as in the [[Republic of Ireland]]), or they may be in day-to day charge, but taking orders from the president as in [[France]].
