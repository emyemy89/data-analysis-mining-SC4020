It is the [[official language]] of [[Greece]] (Hellas) and [[Cyprus]]. It was first spoken in Greece and was also once spoken along the coast of [[Asia Minor]] (now a part of Turkey) and in southern [[Italy]]. It was also widely used in Western Asia and Northern Africa at one time. In Greek, the language is called  (ellinik).  Greeks write their language using the [[Greek alphabet]]. The Latin [[alphabet]] (used to write [[English language|English]] and many other languages) came from the Greek alphabet. Many other alphabets around the world also came from the Greek one.  Greek has an unbroken history of being a written language for over 3,000 years. This is longer than any other Indo-European language spoken today. This history is often divided into three parts, [[ancient Greek]], medieval Greek, and modern Greek. The years 330-1453 are called medieval Greek because that's the time of the [[Byzantine Empire]].  Over 15 million people in the world speak Greek now.{{when}} These speakers mostly live in Greece and Cyprus. There are also people in other countries around the world who speak the language. This is largely because people left Greece and emigrated, meaning they moved to other countries. Countries like the [[United States]] and [[Australia]] have a large Greek [[diaspora]].  == Related pages == * [[Greek numbers]] * [[Ancient Greek language]]  == References == {{reflist}}  == Other websites == {{InterWiki|code=el}} {{Wikibookspar||Modern Greek}} * [http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/Greek/ Greek Dictionary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223164907/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/ |date=2012-02-23 }}, from [http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org Webster's Dictionary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223164907/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/ |date=2012-02-23 }}. * [http://greek-language.com/lexical.aids/ Ancient Greek Dictionaries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429031138/http://www.greek-language.com/lexical.aids/ |date=2009-04-29 }}, descriptions of both online dictionaries (with appropriate links) and Greek.
