<title>Arithmetic</title><text>In [[mathematics]], '''arithmetic''' is the basic study of [[number]]s. The four basic arithmetic operations are [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[Division (mathematics)|division]], although other operations such as [[exponentiation]] and extraction of [[Nth root|roots]] are also studied in arithmetic.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-03-17|title=List of Arithmetic and Common Math Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/common-math-symbols/|access-date=2020-08-25|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Definition of Arithmetic|url=https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/arithmetic.html|access-date=2020-08-25|website=www.mathsisfun.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Arithmetic|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/arithmetic|access-date=2020-08-25|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>  Other arithmetic topics includes working with [[signed number]]s, [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]],  [[decimal]]s and [[Percentage|percentages]].  Most people learn arithmetic in [[primary school]], but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned. Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic, and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic. A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include [[carpenter]]s, [[plumber]]s, [[automobile mechanic|auto mechanics]], [[accountant]]s, [[architect]]s, [[Medical doctor|doctors]], and [[nurse]]s. Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics, [[science]], and [[engineering]].  Some arithmetic can be carried out mentally. A [[calculator]] can also be used to perform arithmetic. [[Computer]]s can do it more quickly, which is one reason [[Global Positioning System]] receivers have a small computer inside.  == Examples of arithmetic == * 2+3=5 (adding is [[commutative property|commutative]]: 2+3 is the same as 3+2) * 75=2 (subtracting is not commutative: 75 is different from 57) * 34=12 (multiplying is commutative: 34 is the same as 43) * 62=3 (dividing is not commutative: 62 is different from 26  ==Related pages== * [[Affine arithmetic]] * [[Elementary algebra]] * [[Interval arithmetic]] * [[Modular arithmetic]]  == References == <references /> {{authority control}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Arithmetic}} [[Category:Arithmetics]]   {{Math-stub}}</text>
