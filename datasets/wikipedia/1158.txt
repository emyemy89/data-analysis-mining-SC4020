However, by including it for free on their OS, they did not have to pay royalties to Spyglass Inc., which resulted in a lawsuit and a multi-million USD settlement.  ===Internet Explorer 2=== '''Internet Explorer 2''' was released for Windows 95, [[Windows NT 3.5]], and [[Windows NT 4.0|NT 4.0]] on August 24, 1996 (following a 2.0 beta in November 1995). It featured support for SSL, cookies, [[VRML]], [[RSA]], and [[Usenet|Internet newsgroups]].

Internet Explorer 3 was the first major browser with [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] support, although this support was only partial. It also introduced support for [[ActiveX]] [[ActiveX control|controls]], [[Java applet]]s, inline multimedia, and the [[Platform for Internet Content Selection|PICS]] system for content [[metadata]]. Version 3 also came bundled with [[Internet Mail and News]], [[Microsoft NetMeeting|NetMeeting]], and an early version of the [[Windows Address Book]], and was itself included with Windows 95 OSR 2. Version 3 proved to be the first more popular version of Internet Explorer, which brought with it increased scrutiny. In the months following its release, a number of security and privacy vulnerabilities were found by researchers and hackers.

Installing version 4 on a Windows 95 or Windows NT 4 machine and choosing ''[[Windows Desktop Update]]'' would result in the traditional Windows Explorer also being replaced by a version more akin to a web-browser interface, as well as the Windows desktop itself being web-enabled via [[Active Desktop]]. The integration with Windows, however, was subject to numerous packaging criticisms (see [[United States v. Microsoft]]). This option was no longer available with the installers for later versions of Internet Explorer but was not removed from the system if already installed. Internet Explorer 4 introduced support for [[Group Policy]], allowing companies to configure and lock down many aspects of the browser's configuration as well as support for offline browsing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa768170(VS.85).aspx |title=Supporting Offline Browsing in Applications and Components |author= |work= |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate= }}</ref> Internet Mail and News was replaced with [[Outlook Express]], and [[Microsoft Chat]] and an improved NetMeeting were also included. This version also was included with [[Windows 98]]. New features were added that allow you to save and retrieve posts in comment forms which are still not being used today. Internet Explorer 4.5 offered new features such as easier 128-bit encryption. It also offered a dramatic stability improvement over prior versions, particularly the [[68k]] version which was especially prone to freezing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cws.internet.com/file/11708.htm |title=WinPlanet IE4 Review |author= |work= |publisher=cws.internet.com |accessdate= |archive-date=2010-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202224624/http://cws.internet.com/file/11708.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/broadband/reviews/671/internet-explorer-4.html |title=PC Pro IE4 Review |author= |work= |publisher=pcpro.co.uk |accessdate= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macuser.co.uk/macuser/reviews/16079/microsoft-internet-explorer-v40.html |title=MacUser IE 4 Review |author= |work= |publisher=macuser.co.uk |accessdate= |archive-date=2005-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050209093222/http://www.macuser.co.uk/macuser/reviews/16079/microsoft-internet-explorer-v40.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>  {| class="wikitable" style="float:right; font-size:85%; text-align:center;" |- !

With IE7, Internet Explorer has been decoupled from the Windows Shell - unlike previous versions, the Internet Explorer [[ActiveX control]] is not hosted in the Windows Explorer process, but rather runs in a separate Internet Explorer process. It is included with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, and is available for Windows XP Service Pack 2 and later, and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 and later. The original release of Internet Explorer 7 required the computer to pass a [[Windows Genuine Advantage]] validation check prior to installing, but on October 5, 2007, [[Microsoft]] removed this requirement.

It also provides its own dialect of [[ECMAScript]] called [[JScript]].

This has resulted in a number of web pages that appear broken in standards-compliant web browsers and has introduced the need for a "[[quirks mode]]" to allow for rendering improper elements meant for Internet Explorer in these other browsers.  Internet Explorer has introduced a number of extensions to JScript which have been adopted by other browsers. These include the innerHTML property, which returns the HTML string within an element; the XMLHttpRequest object, which allows the sending of HTTP request and receiving of HTTP response; and the designMode attribute of the contentDocument object, which enables rich text editing of HTML documents. Some of these functionalities were not possible until the introduction of the W3C DOM methods. Its [[Ruby character]] extension to HTML is also accepted as a module in W3C XHTML 1.1, though it is not found in all versions of W3C HTML.  Microsoft submitted several other features of IE for consideration by the W3C for standardization. These include the 'behavior' CSS property, which connects the HTML elements with JScript behaviors (known as HTML Components, HTC); [[HTMLplusTIME|HTML+TIME]] profile, which adds timing and media synchronization support to HTML documents (similar to the W3C [[XHTMLplusSMIL|XHTML+SMIL]]); and the [[VML]] [[vector graphics]] file format. However, all were rejected, at least in their original forms. VML was, however, subsequently combined with [[PGML]] (proposed by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]), resulting in the W3C-approved [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] format, currently one of the few vector image formats being used on the web, and which IE is now virtually unique in not supporting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codedread.com/svg-support.php |title=SVG Support Tables |author= |work= |publisher=codedread.com |accessdate= }}</ref>  Other non-standard behaviors include: support for vertical text, but in a syntax different from W3C CSS3 candidate recommendation; Support for a variety of image effects<ref>{{cite web |url=http://webfx.eae.net/tools/filtertool.html |title=Filter Tool (WebFX) |author= |date=May 12, 2005 |work= |publisher=webfx.eae.net |accessdate= |archive-date=October 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016072244/http://webfx.eae.net/tools/filtertool.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> and page transitions, which are not found in W3C CSS; Support for [[obfuscated code|obfuscated]] script code, in particular <code>JScript.Encode()</code>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cbfz3598(VS.85).aspx |title=Using Script Encoder |author= |date=May 12, 2005 |work= |publisher=microsoft.com |accessdate= }}</ref> Support for [[font embedding|embedding]] [[Embedded OpenType|EOT]] fonts in [[Font embedding on the Web|web pages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/default.aspx |title=Font Embedding for the Web |author= |work= |publisher=microsoft.com |accessdate= }}</ref>  ;Favicon The [[favicon]] (short for "favorites icon") introduced by Internet Explorer is now also supported and extended in other browsers. It allows web pages to specify a 16-by-16 pixel image for use in bookmarks. In IE, support was, and still is, provided only for the native Windows ICO format; in other browsers it has now been extended to other types of images such as PNG and GIF.  ;Usability and accessibility  Internet Explorer makes use of the accessibility framework provided in Windows. Internet Explorer is also a user interface for FTP, with operations similar to that of Windows Explorer. [[Pop-up blocking]] and [[tabbed browsing]] were added respectively in Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7. Tabbed browsing can also be added to older versions by installing [[MSN Search Toolbar]] or [[Yahoo Toolbar]].  ;Cache {{Main|Temporary Internet Files|Index.dat}}  Internet Explorer caches visited content in the [[Temporary Internet Files]] folder to allow quicker access (or offline access) to previously visited pages. The content is indexed in a database file, known as [[Index.dat]]. Multiple [[Index.dat]] files exist which index different content - visited content, [[web feed]]s, visited [[URL]]s, cookies, etc.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://blogs.msdn.com/wndp/archive/2006/08/04/WinInet_Index_dat.aspx | title = A bit about WinInet's Index.dat | publisher = [[MSDN]] blogs | accessdate = March 7, 2008 | author = Windows Core Networking Team}}</ref>  Prior to IE7, clearing the cache used to clear the index but the files themselves were not reliably removed, posing a potential security and privacy risk. In IE7 and later, when the cache is cleared, the cache files are more reliably removed, and the index.dat file is overwritten with null bytes.  ;Group Policy  {{Main|Group Policy}} Internet Explorer is fully configurable using [[Group Policy]]. Administrators of [[Windows Server domain]]s can apply and enforce a variety of settings that affect the user interface (such as disabling menu items and individual configuration options), as well as underlying security features such as downloading of files, zone configuration, per-site settings, ActiveX control behavior and others. Policy settings can be configured for each user and for each machine. Internet Explorer also supports [[Integrated Windows Authentication]].  ==Architecture== [[File:IExplore.svg|thumb|right|225px|The architecture of IE8. Previous versions had a similar architecture, except that both tabs and the UI were within the same process. Consequently, each browser window could have only one "tab process".]] Internet Explorer uses a [[software componentry|componentized]] architecture built on the [[Component Object Model]] (COM) technology. It consists of several major components, each of which is contained in a separate [[Dynamic-link library]] (DLL) and exposes a set of COM [[interface (computing)|programming interfaces]] hosted by the Internet Explorer main executable, <code>iexplore.exe</code>:<ref name="architecture">{{cite web|url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa741312.aspx |title = Internet Explorer Architecture | publisher = [[MSDN]] |accessdate = January 10, 2007}}</ref> * ''WinInet.dll'' is the protocol handler for [[HTTP]], [[HTTPS]] and [[FTP]]. It handles all network communication over these protocols. * ''URLMon.dll'' is responsible for [[MIME]]-type handling and download of web content, and provides a thread-safe wrapper around WinInet.dll and other protocol implementations. * ''MSHTML.dll'' houses the [[Trident (rendering engine)|Trident]] [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering engine]] introduced in Internet Explorer 4, which is responsible for displaying the pages on-screen and handling the [[Document Object Model]] of the web pages. MSHTML.dll parses the HTML/CSS file and creates the internal [[Document Object Model|DOM]] tree representation of it. It also exposes a set of [[API]]s for runtime inspection and modification of the DOM tree. The DOM tree is further processed by a layout engine which then renders the internal representation on screen. * ''IEFrame.dll'' contains the user interface and window of IE in Internet Explorer 7 and above. * ''ShDocVw.dll'' provides the navigation, local caching and history functionalities for the browser. * ''BrowseUI.dll'' is responsible for the browser user interface, including the browser chrome, which houses all the menus and toolbars. <ref>{{cite web| author = Chris Wilson | publisher = MSDN Channel9 | accessdate = March 7, 2008 | url = http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=388331 | title = Inside IE8 Beta 1 for Developers}}</ref>  Internet Explorer does not include any native scripting functionality. Rather, MSHTML.dll exposes an API that permit a programmer to develop a scripting environment to be plugged-in and to access the DOM tree. Internet Explorer 8 includes the bindings for the [[Active Scripting]] engine, which is a part of [[Microsoft Windows]] and allows any language implemented as an Active Scripting module to be used for client-side scripting. By default, only the [[JScript]] and [[VBScript]] modules are provided; third party implementations like [[ScreamingMonkey]] (for [[ECMAScript|ECMAScript 4]] support) can also be used. Microsoft also makes available the [[Microsoft Silverlight]] runtime that allows [[CLI languages]], including [[Dynamic Language Runtime|DLR]]-based dynamic languages like [[IronPython]] and [[IronRuby]], to be used for client-side scripting.  [[Internet Explorer 8]] introduces some major architectural changes, called ''Loosely Coupled IE'' (LCIE). LCIE separates the main window process (frame process) from the processes hosting the different web applications in different tabs (tab processes). A frame process can create multiple tab processes, each of which can be of a different [[Mandatory Integrity Control|integrity level]]; each tab process can host multiple web sites. The processes use asynchronous [[Inter-Process Communication]] to synchronize themselves. Generally, there will be a single frame process for all web sites. In [[Windows Vista]] with Protected Mode turned on, however, opening privileged content (such as local HTML pages) will create a new tab process as it will not be constrained by Protected Mode.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/11/ie8-and-loosely-coupled-ie-lcie.aspx | title = IE8 and Loosely Coupled IE | accessdate = March 18, 2008 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5nE5WF0wW?url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/11/ie8-and-loosely-coupled-ie-lcie.aspx | archivedate = February 1, 2010 | url-status = live }}</ref>  ==Extensibility== Internet Explorer exposes a set of [[Component Object Model]] (COM) interfaces that allow other components to extend the functionality of the browser.<ref name="architecture"/> Extensibility is divided into two types: Browser extensibility and Content extensibility. The browser extensibility interfaces can be used to plug in components to add context menu entries, toolbars, menu items or [[Browser Helper Objects]] (BHO). BHOs are used to extend the feature set of the browser, whereas the other extensibility options are used to expose the feature in the UI. Content extensibility interfaces are used by different content-type handlers to add support for non-native content formats.<ref name="architecture"/> BHOs not only have unrestricted access to the Internet Explorer [[Document Object Model|DOM]] and event model, they also can access the filesystem, registry and other OS components. Content extensibility can be either in terms of ''Active Documents'' (''Doc Objects'') (e.g., [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] or [[MathML]]) or ''[[ActiveX]] controls''.<ref name="architecture"/> ActiveX controls are used for content handlers that render content embedded within an HTML page (e.g., [[Adobe Flash]] or [[Microsoft Silverlight]]). Doc objects are used when the content type will not be embedded in HTML (e.g., [[Microsoft Word]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] or [[XML Paper Specification|XPS]]). In fact, the Trident rendering engine is itself exposed as a Doc object, so HTML in itself is treated as an Active Document.<ref name="architecture"/>  Internet Explorer add-on components run with the same privileges as the browser itself, unlike client-side scripts that have a very limited set of privileges. Add-ons can be installed either locally, or directly by a web site. Since the add-ons have a more privileged access to the system, malicious add-ons can and have been used to compromise the security of the system. Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 2 onwards provide various safeguards against this, including an [[Plug-in (computing)|Add-on]] Manager for controlling ActiveX controls and Browser Helper Objects and a "No Add-Ons" mode of operation as well as greater restrictions on sites installing add-ons.  Internet Explorer itself can be hosted by other applications via a set of COM interfaces. This can be used to embed the browser functionality inside the application. Also, the hosting application can choose to host only the MSHTML.dll rendering engine, rather than the entire browser.<ref name="architecture"/>  {{Other pages|Component Object Model|Browser Helper Object}}  ==Security== Internet Explorer uses a zone-based [[computer security|security]] framework that groups sites based on certain conditions, including whether it is an Internet- or intranet-based site as well as a user-editable whitelist. Security restrictions are applied per zone; all the sites in a zone are subject to the restrictions.  Internet Explorer 6 SP2 onwards uses the ''Attachment Execution Service'' of [[Microsoft Windows]] to mark executable files downloaded from the Internet as being potentially unsafe. Accessing files marked as such will prompt the user to make an explicit trust decision to execute the file, as executables originating from the Internet can be potentially unsafe. This helps in preventing accidental installation of malware.  Internet Explorer 7 introduced the phishing filter, that restricts access to [[phishing]] sites unless the user overrides the decision. With version 8, it also blocks access to sites known to host [[malware]]. Downloads are also checked to see if they are known to be malware-infected.  In [[Windows Vista]], Internet Explorer by default runs in what is called ''Protected Mode'', where the privileges of the browser itself are severely restricted - it cannot make any system-wide changes. One can optionally turn this mode off but this is not recommended. This also effectively restricts the privileges of any add-ons. As a result, even if the browser or any add-on is compromised, the damage the security breach can cause is limited.  Patches and updates to the browser are released periodically and made available through the Windows Update service, as well as through [[Automatic Updates]]. Although security patches continue to be released for a range of platforms, most feature additions and security infrastructure improvements are only made available on operating systems which are in Microsoft's mainstream support phase.  On December 16, 2008, [[Trend Micro]] recommended users switch to rival browsers until an emergency IE patch was released to fix a potential security risk which "could allow outside users to take control of a person's computer and steal their passwords". Microsoft representatives countered this recommendation, claiming that "0.02% of internet sites" were affected by the flaw.  On December 17, 2008, a fix to the security problem above became available, with the release of the Security Update for Internet Explorer KB960714, which is available from Microsoft Windows Update's webpage. Microsoft has said that this update fixes the security risk found by Trend Micro the previous day.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/world/north-america/security-risk-detected-in-internet-explorer-software-14110209.html |title=Security risk detected in Internet Explorer software |date=December 16, 2008 |newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7784908.stm |newspaper=BBC News | title=Serious security flaw found in IE | date=December 16, 2008 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>  ===Security vulnerabilities=== {{Other pages|Comparison of web browsers#Vulnerabilities}} Internet Explorer has been subjected to many security vulnerabilities and concerns:<!-- Now, in one sentence, we answer how the security issues, enumerated and detailed ELSEWHERE, affect people such that the volume of criticism for IE is unusually high --> Much of the [[spyware]], [[adware]], and [[computer virus]]es across the Internet are made possible by exploitable bugs and flaws in the security architecture of Internet Explorer, sometimes requiring nothing more than viewing of a malicious web page in order to install themselves. This is known as a "[[drive-by install]]". There are also attempts to trick the user into installing malicious software by misrepresenting the software's true purpose in the description section of an [[ActiveX]] security alert.  A number of security flaws affecting IE originated not in the browser itself, but [[ActiveX]]-based add-ons used by it. Because the add-ons have the same privilege as IE, the flaws can be as critical as browser flaws. This has led to the ActiveX-based architecture being criticized for being fault-prone. By 2005, some experts maintained that the dangers of ActiveX have been overstated and there were safeguards in place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1785769,00.asp |title=The Lame Blame of ActiveX |date=April 14, 2005 |accessdate=April 7, 2006 |work = Security  Opinions |publisher=eWeek |last=Seltzer |first=Larry }}</ref> In 2006, new techniques using automated testing found more than a hundred vulnerabilities in standard Microsoft ActiveX components.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11403 |title=ActiveX security faces storm before calm |date=July 31, 2006 |accessdate=July 11, 2009 |work = |publisher=Security Focus |last=Lemos |first=Robert }}</ref> Security features introduced in then recently released Internet Explorer 7 mitigated some of these vulnerabilities.  Internet Explorer in 2008 had a number of published security vulnerabilities. According to research done by security research firm [[Secunia]], Microsoft did not respond as quickly as its competitors in fixing security holes and making patches available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://secunia.com/gfx/Secunia2008Report.pdf |title=Secunia 2008 Report |publisher=Secunia }}</ref> The firm also reported 366 vulnerabilities in ActiveX controls, an increase from the prior year.  According to the latest information, Secunia reports that IE6 has 24 known unpatched vulnerabilities, IE7 has 11, and IE8 has 4. The most severe unpatched Secunia advisories affecting Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x with all vendor patches applied, are all rated Extremely critical. The oldest known unpatched vulnerabilities for IE6, IE7, and IE8 date from November 7, 2003, June 6, 2006, and February 26, 2007 respectively.  According to the latest information, security research firm [[SecurityFocus]] reports that IE6 has 396 known unpatched vulnerabilities, IE7 has 22, and IE8 has 25.

Since the integration of Internet Explorer 2.0 with Windows 95 OSR 1 in 1996, and especially after version 4.0's release, the adoption was greatly accelerated: from below 20% in 1996 to about 40% in 1998 and over 80% in 2000.

After having fought and won the [[browser wars]] of the late 1990s, Internet Explorer gained almost total dominance of the browser market. Having attained a peak of about 95% during 2002 and 2003, its market share has since declined at a slow but steady pace. This is mainly due to the adoption of [[Mozilla Firefox]], which statistics indicate is currently the most significant competition. Nevertheless, Internet Explorer remains the dominant web browser, with a global usage share of around 60% (though measurements vary). Usage is higher in Asia and lower in Europe.

Many versions of IE had some support for an older OS but stopped getting updates. The increased growth of the Internet in the 1990s and 2000s means that current browsers with small market shares have more total users than the entire market early on.

By 2007, IE had much narrower OS support, with the latest versions supporting only Windows XP Service Pack 2 and above.

Microsoft has discontinued standalone installers for Internet Explorer to the general public. However, there are unofficial procedures for downloading the complete install package.

Launching this executable provides the user with the older IE6 interface, however web pages are rendered using the IE7 engine. The IE6 engine can be re-enabled by placing a file named "iexplore.exe.local" into the IE7 folder.

The idea of removing a stock install of Internet Explorer from a Windows system was proposed during the United States v. Microsoft court case. One of Microsoft's arguments, during the trial, was that removing Internet Explorer from Windows may result in system instability.  Removing Internet Explorer does have a number of consequences. Applications that depend on libraries installed by IE will fail to function, or have unexpected behaviors. The Windows help and support system will also not function due to the heavy reliance on [[HTML help]] files and components of IE. In versions of Windows before [[Windows Vista|Vista]], it is also not possible to run Microsoft's [[Windows Update]] or [[Microsoft Update]] with any other browser due to the service's implementation of an [[ActiveX]] control, which no other browser supports. In Windows Vista, [[Windows Update]] is implemented as a [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]] applet.  With Windows 7, Microsoft added the ability to safely remove Internet Explorer 8 from Windows.<ref name="Internet Explorer 8 can be removed from Windows 7"> {{cite web|url=http://winjade.net/2009/03/ie8-functionally-removable/ |title=Internet Explorer 8 can be removed from Windows 7 |date=March 3, 2009 |publisher=AeroXperience |first=Bryant |last=Zadegan |accessdate=March 3, 2009}}</ref> Microsoft does not allow the dependencies to be removed through this process, but the Internet Explorer executable (iexplore.exe) is removed without harming any other Windows components.  ==Related pages== * [[Web 2.0]]  ==References== {{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}  {{Refbegin}} * {{cite web|title=Microsoft Windows Family Home Page |work=Windows History: Internet Explorer History |url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/WinHistoryIE.mspx |accessdate=May 12, 2005}} * {{cite web|title=IEBlog |work=IE7 Is Coming This Month |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/06/IE7-Is-Coming-This-Month_2E002E002E00_Are-you-Ready_3F00_.aspx |accessdate=October 9, 2006 }} {{Refend}}  ==Other websites== {{Wikinews|France, Germany officials warn against using Internet Explorer}} * Official website: [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/ microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer] * [http://blogs.msdn.com/ie IEBlog - MSDN Blogs]  The weblog of the Internet Explorer team * [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa741312.aspx Internet Explorer Architecture] * [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/community/ Internet Explorer Community]  The official Microsoft Internet Explorer Community * [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/WinHistoryIE.mspx Internet Explorer History] * [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Bb250448.aspx IE Leak Patterns]  Microsoft's analysis of how web pages can cause memory leaks in Internet Explorer, and how developers can prevent them.
