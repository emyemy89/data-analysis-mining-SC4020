Farming is a part of [[agriculture]].   Agriculture started thousands of years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is.<ref>Colin Tudge argues "from at least 40,000 years ago... people were managing their environment to such an extent that they can properly be called 'proto-farmers'". Tudge, Colin 1998. ''Neanderthals, bandits and farmers: how agriculture really began''. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, p3. {{ISBN|0-297-84258-7}}</ref> The development of farming gave rise to the [[Neolithic Revolution]] whereby people gave up [[nomad]]ic [[hunting]] and became [[settler]]s in what became [[cities]].  Agriculture and [[domestication]] probably started in the [[Fertile Crescent]] (the [[Nile]] Valley, The [[Levant]] and [[Mesopotamia]]).<ref>Harris, David (ed) 1996. ''The origins and spread of agriculture and pastoralism in [[Eurasia]]: crops, fields, flocks and herds''. University College London Press. {{ISBN|1-56098-675-1}}</ref> The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], and [[Egypt]]. [[Wheat]] and [[barley]] are some of the first crops people grew. People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people than [[hunter-gatherer]]s can feed on the same amount of land.  == Types of farming == === Arable farming === Arable farming means growing [[crops]]. This would include [[wheat]] or vegetables like [[brussels sprout]]s. Growing [[fruit]] means having [[orchard]]s devoted to fruit. They cannot be switched easily with growing  field crops. Therefore they are not classed as arable land in the statistics.  Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals, but also growing other things like [[flower]]s and [[nursery]] [[plant]]s, manure or dung, animal hides ([[skin]]s or [[fur]]s), [[leather]], animals, fungi, [[fiber]]s ([[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], and [[flax]]), [[biofuel]] , and [[drug]]s (bio[[pharmaceuticals]], [[marijuana]], [[opium]]).  Many people still live by [[subsistence agriculture]], on a small farm. They can only grow enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals. The [[yield]] is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and it is often low. This is because subsistence farmers are generally less [[education|educated]], and they have less [[money]] to buy equipment. [[Drought]] and other problems sometimes cause [[famine]]s. Where yields are low, [[deforestation]] can provide new land to grow more food. This provides more [[nutrition]] for the farmer's family, but can be bad for the country and the surrounding [[environment]] over many years.  In some countries, farms are often fewer and larger. During the 20th century they have become more productive because farmers are able to grow better [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests. Many farms also use machines, so fewer people can farm more land. There are fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to grow more.  This kind of [[intensive agriculture]] comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, [[pesticide]]s (chemicals that kill bugs), and [[herbicide]]s (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can [[pollute]] the [[soil]] or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by [[erosion]] (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or loss of structure. [[Irrigation]] (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. These problems have all got solutions, and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education.  Farmers select plants with better yield, taste, and [[nutrition]]al value. They also choose plants that can survive [[plant disease]] and [[drought]], and are easier to harvest. Centuries of [[artificial selection]] and breeding have changed crop plants. The crops produce better yield. [[Fertilizers]], chemical [[pest control]], and [[irrigation]] all help.  Some plants are improved with  [[genetic engineering]]. One example is modifying the plant to resist herbicides.  == Agriculture topics == * [[Fertilizer]]s * [[Crop rotation]] * [[Weed]] removal * [[Breeding]] * [[Agricultural fencing|Fencing]] * [[Ranching]] * [[Plantation]] * [[Crop protection]]  == Food == It is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and good. People say it is not always safe, because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture. * Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries. * Intensive agriculture is mostly done in countries with more money. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers. * Organic farming is using only natural products such as compost and green manure. * Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process.  [[Agricultural policy]] focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. Common goals of policy include the quality, amount, and safety of food.  == Problems in agriculture == There are some serious problems that people face trying to grow food today. These include: * [[Erosion]] * [[Diseases]] * [[Pests]] * [[Weed]]s * [[Drought]] * [[Rainfall]]  == Crops == The major crops produced in the world in 2002, are maize (corn), wheat, rice, and cotton.  * [[Maize]] 624 million metric tons * [[Wheat]] 570 million metric tons * [[Rice]] 381.1 million metric tons * [[Cotton]] 96.5 million metric tons  == Related pages == {{Commons category|Agriculture|Farming}} * [[Aquaculture]] * [[Bee keeping]] * [[Animal husbandry]]  == References == {{reflist}}  [[Category:Agriculture| ]]</text>
