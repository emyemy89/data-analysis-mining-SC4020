<title>Wikipedia:Protection policy</title><text>{{pp-protected|small=yes}} {{policy|WP:P|WP:PROTECT}} [[Wikipedia:Administrators|Administrators]] can protect pages to stop them from being changed. They can also unprotect pages. There are five types of protection; full protection, semi-protection, move protection, cascading protection and create protection.  == Full protection == [[File:Full-protection-shackle.svg|75px|right]] Full protection stops users from changing pages unless they are [[Wikipedia:Administrators and Bureaucrats|administrators]]. An administrator can set when the protection ends. This gives ''temporary'' protection. If there is no time set the page is protected ''indefinitely''.  ''Indefinite'' protections can be used for:  * Pages that are likely to be vandalised a lot, like the [[Main Page]]. * The site's logo, press releases, and key copyright and license pages, for [[legal]] reasons. * Personal [[Cascading Style Sheets|css]] and [[JavaScript|js]] pages; these are automatically fully protected by the [[MediaWiki]] software. Only the user whose account it is and [[Wikipedia:Interface administrators|interface administrators]] can change them.  ''Temporary'' full protections can be used for: *Enforcing a time to stop a [[Wikipedia:Edit war|change war]]. *Preventing abuse of the {{tl|unblock}} template or other disruptions by a [[Wikipedia:Blocks and bans|blocked]] user on their user talk page.  =={{anchor|semi}}Semi-protection== [[File:Semi-protection-shackle.svg|75px|right]] Semi-protection of a page stops unregistered editors ([[IP]] addresses) and editors with accounts not more than four days old or having less than 10 edits from editing pages.  Semi-protection should only be used if it is the only option left available to solve the problem of [[Wikipedia:vandalism|vandalism]] of the page. It is to be used in response to serious and repeated vandalism, such as when certain pages suddenly become the target of repeated vandalism because of current events, are being linked from a high-traffic website, or are affected by evasive vandals.{{clarify}}  ==Move protection== [[File:Move-protection-shackle.svg|75px|right]] Move protection prevents articles from being moved by users unless they are [[Wikipedia:Administrators and Bureaucrats|administrators]]. Move protection includes:  *Continued or on-going page-move vandalism. *Page name dispute. *Articles which have no reason to be moved.  == Cascading protection == [[File:Cascade-protection-shackle.svg|75px|right]] Cascading protection fully protects any page [[Wikipedia:Transclusion|transcluded]] onto the protected page. Cascading protection cannot be used with semi-protection.  Cascading protection can be used: *On pages that are seen a lot, like the [[Main Page]] when vandalism is frequent. *To prevent creation of pages that get recreated a lot after being deleted. See [[Wikipedia:Protected deleted pages|protected deleted pages]].  ==Create protection== [[File:Create-protection-shackle.svg|75px|right]]  Create protection allows administrators to either semi-protect or full-protect pages that have not been made yet, this can also be done by  the [[MediaWiki:Titleblacklist|Titleblacklist]].  A list of create-protected pages can be found at [[Special:Protectedtitles]].  ==Unprotection== Any admin can unprotect a page. When a page is protected admins can set a time for when the protection expires, when the time is up the page is automatically unprotected.   ==Related pages== * [[m:Protected pages considered harmful]] * [[Special:Protectedpages]] * [[Special:ProtectedTitles|Protected deleted pages]] * [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|Deletion Policy]]  [[Category:Wikipedia policies|*]]  [[ru:: ]]</text>
