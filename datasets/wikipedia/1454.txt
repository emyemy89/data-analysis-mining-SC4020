<title>Flavor</title><text>'''Flavour''' or '''flavor''' ([[US English]]) is the main [[quality]] of anything which affects the [[taste]]. When someone remarks on the ''flavor'' of something they are trying to describe the specific way something tastes.  Flavor can also be used to describe the act of adding a taste alteration (to change the taste) to something. This is usually done by adding [[spice]]s or [[sugar]]s, though in ''processed food'' there are oftentimes artificial (fake) flavors.   {{food-stub}}   [[Category:Food and drink]] [[Category:Characteristics]]  [[hu:Aroma]]</text>
