People with a mental illness may behave in strange ways  or have strange thoughts in their view or the view of others. Mental illnesses can affect the day to day functioning of a person.   Mental illnesses develop during the life of a person. This may be linked to [[genes]] and experience. What is considered as a mental illness has changed over time. What is considered to be a mental illness may not be one in a different culture. The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] is used around the world.   People with a mental illness sometimes have problems dealing with other people, or struggle with daily functioning. Treatment and certain medications can help people with daily functioning.  In some cases, mental illnesses change the way the [[brain]] works. Many conditions which affect the brain are not mental illnesses, as they do not change the way in which people think: Neither [[epilepsy]] nor [[Parkinson's disease]] is a mental illness, yet both affect the brain.   == Common mental problems == According to the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health in the United States, the most common type of [[disability]] in the United States is major mental illnesses (which include major [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[personality disorder]]s, [[body dysmorphic disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]).  Thirty-three percent of North American adults will have a mental illness in a given year, according to the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]].  But in more than half of these cases, the mental illness is not bad enough to disrupt daily life activities.  === Partly inherited === There is a [[genetic]] basis which makes some people more likely to develop mental illness. A study published in ''The Lancet'', a medical journal, found the same set of genetic [[mutation|markers]] in people with five different disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, [[autism]], major depression, and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).<ref>Kolata, Gene 2013.

Statistically, violence is often caused by factors such as drug abuse, or those related to the personal, social and economic situation.<ref name="pmid19188537">{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2008.537 |title=The Intricate Link Between Violence and Mental Disorder: Results from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions |year=2009 |last1=Elbogen |first1=Eric B. |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=15261 |pmid=19188537 |last2=Johnson |first2=SC}}</ref>  Findings show that people with a mental illness that live in the community will be victims of violence more often that they will be those starting or spreading it.<ref name="Stuart03"/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ps.52.10.1358 |title=Risks for Individuals with Schizophrenia Who Are Living in the Community |year=2001 |last1=Brekke |first1=John S. |journal=Psychiatric Services |volume=52 |issue=10 |pages=135866 |pmid=11585953 |last2=Prindle |first2=C |last3=Bae |first3=SW |last4=Long |first4=JD}}</ref> A study that looked at people diagnosed with "severe mental illness" living in a US inner-city area found that a quarter of them had been victims of at least one violent crime over the course of a year; this proportion was eleven times higher than the [[average]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.62.8.911 |title=Crime Victimization in Adults with Severe Mental Illness: Comparison with the National Crime Victimization Survey |year=2005 |last1=Teplin |first1=Linda A. |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=62 |issue=8 |pages=91121 |pmid=16061769 |last2=McClelland |first2=GM |last3=Abram |first3=KM |last4=Weiner |first4=DA |pmc=1389236}}</ref> For people which have been diagnosed with a mental illness it is more difficult to get a trial started, because fewer people believe them, and many people have a [[wikt:prejudice|prejudice]] against people with a mental illness.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/009385480102800601 |title=Crime Victims with Developmental Disabilities: A Review Essay |year=2001 |last1=Petersilia |first1=J.

These include conditions such as childhood [[conduct disorder]], adult [[antisocial personality disorder]] or [[psychopathy]]. There are conflicting findings about how much specific symptoms are linked to an increase in violent behaviour. These symptoms include [[psychosis]] ([[hallucinations]] or [[delusions]]) that can occur in disorders such as schizophrenia, delusional disorder or mood disorder. The factors that lead to violent behaviour are more often demographic or economic in nature, such as being young, male, of lower [[socioeconomic status]] or of abusing drugs, including [[alcoholism]], to which some people are particularly vulnerable.<ref name="Rogers&Pilgram05">{{cite book |author=Pilgrim, David; Rogers, Anne |title=A sociology of mental health and illness |publisher=Open University Press |location=Milton Keynes |year=2005 |isbn=0-335-21583-1 |edition=3rd}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref><ref name="Stuart03">{{Cite journal |author=Stuart H |title=Violence and mental illness: an overview |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=121124 |date=June 2003|pmid=16946914 |pmc=1525086}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.55.5.393 |title=Violence by People Discharged from Acute Psychiatric Inpatient Facilities and by Others in the Same Neighborhoods |year=1998 |last1=Steadman |first1=H.
