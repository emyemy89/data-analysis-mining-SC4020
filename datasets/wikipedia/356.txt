It is to the east of the [[Pacific Ocean]], the west of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the south of the [[Arctic Ocean]], and it is the northern part of [[the Americas]]. The southernmost part is [[Central America]]. It is the third largest continent in the world, after Asia and Africa.   Hundreds of millions of years ago, North America was part of a larger ancient supercontinent named [[Laurasia]]. A few million years ago, a new [[land bridge]] arose and connected North America to South America. [[Beringia]] connected North America to [[Siberia]] a few times during [[ice age]]s in the past 20,000 years. North America has a population of 527 million and is the 4th most populous continent in the world.   == List of Countries == * {{flag|Anguilla}} * {{flag|Antigua and Barbuda}} * {{flag|Bahamas}} * {{flag|Belize}} * {{flag|Bermuda}} * {{flag|Barbados}} * {{flag|British Virgin Islands}} * {{flag|Cayman Islands}} * {{flag|Canada}} * {{flag|Costa Rica}} * {{flag|Cuba}} * {{flag|Dominica}} * {{flag|Dominican Republic}} * {{flag|El Salvador}} * {{flag|Grenada}} * {{flag|Greenland}} * {{flag|Guatemala}} * {{flag|Guadeloupe}} * {{flag|Haiti}} * {{flag|Honduras}} * {{flag|Iceland}} Geologically located in Europe and North America * {{flag|Jamaica}} * {{flag|Martinique}} * {{flag|Mexico}} * {{flag|Montserrat}} * {{flag|Nicaragua}} * {{flag|Panama}} * {{flag|Puerto Rico}} * {{flag|Saint Barthlemy}} * {{flag|Saint Kitts and Nevis}} * {{flag|Saint Lucia}} * {{flag|Sint Maarten}} * {{flag|Saint Martin}} * {{flag|Saint Pierre and Miquelon}} * {{flag|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines}} * {{flag|Turks and Caicos Islands}} * {{flag|United States}} * {{flag|US Virgin Islands}} * {{flagcountry|SNA}}  == Related pages== * [[Central America]] * [[Americas]]  {{Continent}} {{North America}}  {{north-America-stub}}  [[Category:North America| ]]</text>
