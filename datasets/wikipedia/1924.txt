<title>Republic</title><text>A '''republic''' is a king-less form of [[government]] that has no [[monarch]]y and no hereditary [[aristocracy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/civ/6a.asp|title=The Roman Republic [ushistory.org]  |website=www.ushistory.org  |access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> It originates from '''Rome, in 509 B.C'''. when the Romans overthrew the [[Roman kingdom]].  Once free, the Romans established a republic, a government in which citizens elected representatives to rule on their behalf.  The national [[sovereignty]] lies in the authority of the government and not in an emperor or monarch. The word republic comes from the [[Latin]] language words '''res publica''',  which means a "public thing". For example, the [[United States]] is a republic and [[India]] is a republic, but [[North Korea]] and [[Cuba]] are also called republics. However, [[Britain]] and [[Canada]] are ''not'' republics, since they have a monarch ([[Queen Elizabeth II]] in both cases).  Countries with a king or other [[monarch]] and free elections is called a [[constitutional monarchy]] and are not called republics. A constitutional monarchy resembles a republic because the constitution has been amended to remove power from the monarch and install institutions conforming to a philosophy of republicanism. This includes the [[United Kingdom]] and the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, the [[Netherlands]], [[Thailand]], [[Scandinavia]]n and various other countries. What makes a republic different, is that laws are made and enforced without royal authority.  The [[Head of State]] in a republic is generally a person who has been chosen by the [[citizen]]s, either by [[direct election]] or by a group of elected representatives to act as the top representative of the people.  In most republics, the Head of State is called the [[president]]. In some countries, the president is elected and has a lot of political power. In others, the president does not hold much direct power, but is important in the legal system for other reasons.  Sometimes a state is called a "republic" when its head is not called "king" but something else. For example, the [[Roman Empire]] had an "Emperor" and the [[Dutch Republic]] had a "Stadholder" but they worked as [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarchs]].  [[Licchavi]] in [[India]] was the first republic in the 6th and 5th century BCE. The earliest republics that were much imitated later were [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] cities in the eastern [[Mediterranean]] area. The biggest difference from other [[Polis|city-states]] at that time was that people chose their leaders by [[voting]]. The votes were counted, and the person with the most votes won.  ==References== {{reflist}}  [[Category:Forms of government]]</text>
