Scotland was once an independent country and had its own [[monarch]], but is now in a union with England, [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], which is called the United Kingdom. In 1603, the [[King]] of Scotland, [[James I of England|James VI]], became King of England too, because Queen [[Elizabeth I]] of England died and had no son or daughter to take her place as king or queen. In 1707, the [[parliament of Scotland]] joined with the [[parliament of England]] to become the [[Parliament of Great Britain]].

The [[Atlantic Ocean]] borders the west coast and the [[North Sea]] is to the east. The island of [[Ireland]] is only 30 [[kilometre]]s (20 [[miles|mi]]) from the southern part of [[Kintyre]],<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/place/North-Channel-strait North Channel], Encyclopdia Britannica. Retrieved 2016-05-02.</ref> [[Norway]] is 305&nbsp;kilometers (190&nbsp;mi) to the east and the [[Faroe Islands]] are 270&nbsp;kilometres (168&nbsp;mi) to the north. Scotland's land also includes several islands, including the [[Inner Hebrides|Inner]] and [[Outer Hebrides]] off the west coast and the [[archipelago]]es of [[Orkney Islands|Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] to the north of the mainland.  Compared to the other areas of the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, Scotland is sparsely populated, most especially the northwestern half of it.   The main geographical feature that dictates this is the [[Highland Boundary Fault]] which roughly splits the country in half from the southwest to the northeast.   To the north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault are the more mountainous [[Scottish Highlands]] and islands, and this half of the country contains less than 5% of the total population.  To the south and east of the Highland Boundary Fault is the [[Scottish Lowlands]], which contain the vast majority (about 75%) of the Scottish population, and 3 of the 4 biggest cities ([[Glasgow]] which is 1st, [[Edinburgh]] which is 2nd, and Dundee which is 4th).  Below the lowlands are the Southern Uplands which are hilly, but not as hilly at the Highlands.  They are less densely populated than the lowlands, but still a lot more dense than the highlands and islands.    Located within the central part of the lowlands is the Central Belt, a rectangle of land roughly 88 kilometers (55 miles) from West to East and 48 kilometers (30 miles) North to South.  About half of the population of Scotland lives within these roughly 4,530 square kilometers (or 1,750 square miles), which is a little more than 2% of the total land area of Scotland.  This is the area between Scotlands two largest cities - Glasgow, at the Central Belts Western end, and Edinburgh, at the Central Belts Eastern end.  This area is geographically bound by two bays of water  the Firth of Clyde to the West and the Firth of Forth to the East.  It is the most fertile Earth in Scotland, which is why it is so population-dense, compared to the rest of the country.

Page 70.</ref> Of the [[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], and [[Iron Age]] [[civilization]] that existed in the country, many [[fossil]]s remain, but no written records were left behind. These people did not have [[writing]].  The written history of Scotland begins when the [[Roman Empire]] came to Britain, and the Romans invaded what is now [[England]] and [[Wales]], calling it [[Roman Britain|Britannia]]. To the north was ''Caledonia'', land not fully owned by the Romans. Only the southern Caledonia was conquered by the Romans, who founded cities like Edinburg when created the [[Antonine wall]]. Its people were the [[Picts]]. This meant the Scottish were not affected by the Romans in the same way the English were. The sea was very important for trade reasons.  Because of where Scotland is in the world and its strong [[wikt:reliance|reliance]] on trade routes by sea, the nation held close links in the south and east with the Baltic countries, and through Ireland with France and Europe. Following the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] and [[Industrial Revolution]], Scotland grew to be one of the largest commercial, intellectual and industrial states in Europe.  ===Wars of Independence=== [[File:William Wallace.jpg|Sir William Wallace|thumb|right]] {{main|Wars of Scottish Independence}} The [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] were many military [[campaign]]s fought between '''Scotland''' and [[England]] in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.  The First War (12961328) began with the [[Kingdom of England|English]] invasion of Scotland in 1296, and ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton]] in 1328. The Second War (13321357) began with the [[England|English]]-supported invasion of Scotland by [[Edward Balliol]] and the 'Disinherited' in 1332, and ended around 1357 with the signing of the Treaty of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]].  The wars were part of a great national crisis for Scotland and the period became one of the most important moments in the nation's history. At the end of both wars, Scotland still was a free and independent country, which was its main aim throughout the conflict. The wars were also important for other reasons, such as the invention of the [[longbow]] as an important weapon in [[medieval warfare]].  A series of deaths in the line of succession in the 1280s, followed by King [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]]'s death in 1286 left the Scottish crown in crisis. His granddaughter, [[Margaret I of Scotland|Margaret, the "Maid of Norway"]], a four-year-old girl, was the heir.  [[Edward I of England]], as Margaret's great-uncle, suggested that his son (also a child) and Margaret should marry, stabilising the Scottish line of succession. In 1290 Margaret's guardians agreed to this, but Margaret herself died in [[Orkney]] on her voyage from Norway to Scotland of [[sea sickness]] before she was made Queen, or her wedding could take place.  Because there was no clear heir to the throne anymore, the Scottish people decided to ask Edward I of England to choose their king. The strongest candidate was called [[Robert Bruce]]. Robert Bruce had castles all around the country, and had a private army. But Edward wanted to invade Scotland, so he chose the weaker candidate, who was [[John I of Scotland|John Balliol]]. He had the strongest claim to the throne, and became king on 30 November 1292. Robert Bruce decided to accept this decision (his grandson and [[wikt:namesake|namesake]] later took the throne as Robert I).  [[File:SterlingBridge.jpg|thumb|right|Stirling Bridge in 2006]] Over the next few years, Edward I kept trying to undermine both the authority of King John and the independence of Scotland. In 1295, John, on the recommendation of his chief councillors, entered into an alliance with [[France]]. This was the beginning of the [[Auld Alliance]].  In 1296, Edward invaded Scotland. He removed King John from power, and put him in jail. The following year [[William Wallace]] and [[Andrew de Moray]] raised an army from the southern and northern parts of the country to fight the English. Under their joint leadership, an English army was defeated at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]]. For a short time Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as Guardian of the realm.  Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the [[Battle of Falkirk]] in 1298. Wallace escaped but resigned as Guardian of Scotland. [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]] and [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] were put in his place. In 1305 Wallace was captured by the English, who executed him for treason. Wallace claimed he did not commit treason as he was not loyal to England. [[File:Robert the Bruce.jpg|Robert Bruce|thumb|200px|right]]  In February 1306 Robert Bruce murdered John Comyn, a leading rival, in a [[church]]. Bruce went on to take the crown, but Edward's army overran the country yet again after defeating Bruce's small army at the [[Battle of Methven]]. Despite the [[excommunication]] of Bruce and his followers by [[Pope Clement V]], his support slowly strengthened; and by 1314, with the help of leading nobles such as [[Sir James Douglas]] and the [[Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray|Earl of Moray]], only the castles at Bothwell and Stirling were still under English control.  Edward I died in [[Carlisle]] in 1307. His heir, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], moved an army north to break the siege of [[Stirling Castle]] and again take control. Robert defeated that army at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314, securing temporary independence. In 1320, a letter to the Pope from the nobles of Scotland (the [[Declaration of Arbroath]]) went part of the way towards convincing [[Pope John XXII]] to overturn the earlier excommunication and cancel the various acts of submission by Scottish kings to English ones so that Scotland's independence could be recognised by other European countries.  In 1326, the first full [[Parliament of Scotland]] met. The parliament was made from an earlier council of nobility and clergy around 1235, but in 1326 representatives of the burghsthe burgh commissionersjoined them to form the Three Estates.  In 1328, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] signed the [[Treaty of Northampton]] which declared Scottish independence under the rule of Robert the Bruce. Four years after Robert's death in 1329, England invaded Scotland yet again, looking to put the "Rightful King"[[Edward Balliol]], son of John Balliolto the Scottish throne, starting the Second War of Independence. In the face of tough Scottish resistance, led by [[Sir Andrew Murray]], attempts to secure Balliol on the throne failed. Edward III lost interest in Balliol after the outbreak of the [[Hundred Years' War]] with France. In 1341 [[David II of Scotland|David II]], King Robert's son and heir, was able to return from temporary exile in France. Balliol finally resigned his empty claim to the throne to Edward in 1356, before retiring to Yorkshire, where he died in 1364.  === The Norse === Most of the Scottish islands were ruled by the [[Norse]] (and then by [[Norway|Norwegians]] and [[Denmark|Danes]]) for over four hundred years. This includes the [[Hebrides]] to the west and [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] to the north. The islands still have a culture of their own. [[St Kilda]], [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney]] and [[Skara Brae]] are all [[World Heritage Site]]s, as are the [[Antonine Wall]] and [[New Lanark]] on the mainland.  === Since 1603 === In 1603, Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] died and, because she did not have any children, [[James VI of Scotland]] (son of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]) also became King [[James I of England]]. In 1707, Scotland and England were joined in the [[Act of Union]] to make one big Kingdom, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. When [[Ireland]] joined in 1801, the [[United Kingdom]] was created.  In 1997, a majority of voters in Scotland chose to have their own [[Scottish Parliament]], which was set up in 1999. Former [[First Minister of Scotland]] [[Alex Salmond]] led the [[Scottish National Party]] to government in Scotland in 2007 and won an overall majority in 2011, taking 69 out of 129 seats. The [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014]] ended in a majority (55%) voting against independence from the [[United Kingdom]]. Alex Salmond resigned shortly after and was succeeded by [[Nicola Sturgeon]] on 19 November 2014.  The [[Scottish National Party]] won 56 out of the 59 Scottish seats in the [[House of Commons]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015]], while the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] won an overall majority. Scotland had traditionally voted for the [[Labour Party]] in general elections before then.  == Language == The official languages of Scotland are [[English language|English]], [[Lowland Scots|Scots]] and [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]. [[English language|English]] is spoken by most people in Scotland, while only a small number, mostly in the [[Western Isles]], speaks [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/gaelic.html |title=Scotland: Gaelic Language|publisher=www.geo.ed.ac.uk|accessdate=2008-06-23}}</ref> [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] began declining in the late [[Middle Ages]] when Scottish kings and nobles preferred English.  == Sports == === Football === [[File:Oldfirm.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Both sets of fans at an [[Old Firm]] match at [[Celtic Park]].]] [[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Scotland.
