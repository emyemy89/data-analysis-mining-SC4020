The free software project was formerly hosted by [[Sun Microsystems]] and then [[Oracle Corporation]] and is currently hosted by Apache. It is available for many different [[operating system]]s, including [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[OS X]], [[FreeBSD]] and [[Solaris]]; and is meant to be an alternative to [[Microsoft Office]]. It supports Microsoft Office [[file format]]s as well as its own [[OpenDocument]] format.  The ".org" part of the previous name OpenOffice.org is there because OpenOffice is already [[trademark]]ed. It is often called "OOo" for short.  OpenOffice is based on the older [[StarOffice]] software that was created by [[Sun Microsystems]].  == Parts == OpenOffice is a collection of applications that work together closely to provide the features expected from a modern office suite. Many of the parts are designed to be alternatives to those available in Microsoft Office. The parts available include:  {|class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto" |[[File:OOoWriter.svg|48px]] ||'''[[OpenOffice.org Writer|Writer]]'''|| A [[word processor]] similar in [[look and feel]] to [[Microsoft Word]] and offering a comparable range of functions and tools. It also includes the ability to export [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) files with no additional software, and can also function as a [[WYSIWYG]] editor for creating and editing [[web page]]s. |- |[[File:OOoCalc.svg|48px]] ||'''[[OpenOffice.org Calc|Calc]]'''|| A [[spreadsheet]] similar to [[Microsoft Excel]] with a roughly equivalent range of features. Calc provides a number of features not present in Excel, including a system which automatically defines series for graphing, based on the layout of the users data. Calc is also capable of writing spreadsheets directly as a PDF file. |- |[[File:OOoImpress.svg|48px]] ||'''[[OpenOffice.org Impress|Impress]]'''|| A [[presentation program]] similar to [[Microsoft PowerPoint]]. It can export presentations to [[Adobe Flash]] (SWF) files allowing them to be played on any computer with the Flash player installed. It also includes the ability to create PDF files, and the ability to read Microsoft PowerPoint's .ppt format. Impress suffers from a lack of ready-made presentation designs. However, templates are readily available on the Internet.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://claudio.cicali.org/article/70/templates-for-openoffice-impress |title=Caludio's personal hideout: Templates for Openoffice Impress |access-date=2008-08-21 |archive-date=2006-02-23 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060223011553/http://claudio.cicali.org/article/70/templates-for-openoffice-impress |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://documentation.openoffice.org/Samples_Templates/User/template/presentations/index.html Presentation templates at OpenOffice.org]</ref><ref>[http://documentation.openoffice.org/Samples_Templates/User/template_2_x/impress/index.html Impress Templates - User/Template]</ref> |- |[[File:OOoBase.svg|48px]] ||'''[[OpenOffice.org Base|Base]]'''|| A [[database]] program similar to [[Microsoft Access]]. Base allows the creation and manipulation of databases, and the building of forms and reports to provide easy access to data for end-users. As with Access, Base may be used as a front-end to a number of different database systems, including Access databases (JET), [[Open Database Connectivity|ODBC]] data sources and [[MySQL]]/[[PostgreSQL]]. Base became part of the suite starting with version 2.0. Native to the OpenOffice.org suite is an adaptation of [[HSQL]]. While ooBase can be a front-end for any of the databases listed, there is no need for any of them to be installed. |- |[[File:OOoDraw.svg|48px]] ||'''[[OpenOffice.org Draw|Draw]]'''|| A [[vector graphics editor]] comparable in features to early versions of [[CorelDRAW]]. It features versatile "connectors" between shapes, which are available in a range of line styles and facilitate building drawings such as flowcharts. It has similar features to [[Desktop publishing]] software such as [[Scribus]] and [[Microsoft Publisher]].  |- |[[File:OOoMath.svg|48px]] ||'''[[OpenOffice.org Math|Math]]'''|| A tool for creating and editing mathematical formulae, similar to [[Equation Editor|Microsoft Equation Editor]]. Formulae can be embedded inside other OpenOffice.org documents, such as those created by Writer. It supports multiple [[typeface|fonts]] and can export to PDF. |}  == Other websites == {{Commons category|Apache OpenOffice}} *{{Official website|name=www.openoffice.org}}  == References == <references/>  {{Office suites}}  [[Category:Office suites]] [[Category:OpenOffice| ]]</text>
