No new moons were discovered for more than two hundred years. In 1892, [[astronomer]] [[E.E Barnard]] found a new moon using his [[observatory]] in [[California]]. He called the moon [[Amalthea]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phys-astro.sonoma.edu/BruceMedalists/Barnard/ |title=Edward Emerson Barnard |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=The Bruce Medalists }}</ref> It was the last of Jupiter's 67 moons to be discovered by [[human]] observation through a [[telescope]].<ref name=Galileo /> In 1994, bits of the [[comet]] [[Shoemaker Levy-9]] hit Jupiter.

The Pioneer missions were the first spacecraft to take close up pictures of Jupiter and its moons. Five years later, the two Voyager spacecraft discovered over 20 new moons. They captured [[Photography|photo]] [[evidence]] of [[lightning]] on the night side of Jupiter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981JGR....86.8713G |title=The helium abundance of Jupiter from Voyager |accessdate=2009-07-20 |publisher=Harvard University |work= }}</ref>  The [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] probe was sent to study the [[Sun]]. It only went to Jupiter after it had finished its main mission. Ulysses had no [[camera]]s so it took no photographs. In 2006, the Cassini spacecraft, on its way to [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]], took some very good, very clear pictures of the planet. Cassini also found a moon and took a picture of it but it was too far away to show the details.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004Icar..172....1H |title=The Cassini-Huygens flyby of Jupiter |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=Harvard University }}</ref>  The Galileo mission in 1995 was the first spacecraft to go into [[orbit]] around Jupiter. It flew around the planet for seven years and studied the four biggest moons. It launched a probe into the planet to get [[information]] about Jupiter's atmosphere. The probe travelled to a depth of about 150&nbsp;km before it was crushed by the weight of all the [[gas]] above it.<ref name=Gal2>{{cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ |title=Galileo End of Mission Status |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=NASA }}</ref> This is called [[pressure]]. The Galileo spacecraft was also crushed in 2003 when [[NASA]] [[steer]]ed the craft into the planet.

Because of the way they orbit Jupiter, [[gravity]] affects three of these moons greatly. The [[friction]] caused by the gravity of Europa and Ganymede pulling on Io makes it the most [[volcanoes|volcanic]] object in the Solar System. It has over 400 volcanoes, more than three times as many as [[Earth]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004Icar..169..140L |title=Lava lakes on Io: observations of Io's volcanic activity from Galileo NIMS during the 2001 fly-bys |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=Harvard University }}</ref>  == Jupiter in the Solar System == [[File:InnerSolarSystem-en.png|thumb|A diagram of the inner Solar System.

Jupiter protects the inner planets from [[comet]]s by pulling them towards itself. Because of this, Jupiter has the most comet impacts in the Solar System.<ref name="Shoemaker-Levy"/>  Two groups of [[asteroid]]s, called [[Trojan asteroid]]s, have settled into Jupiter's orbit round the Sun.
