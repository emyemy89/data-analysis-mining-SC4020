<title>Miracle</title><text>A '''Miracle''' is an amazing, [[benefit|beneficial]] event that goes (or at least seems to go) against [[natural laws]].  Some people say that a miracle is always an act brought about by [[God]] or other supernatural force (such as an [[angel]]). Others say that there can always be another explanation for it.  ==According to the Bible== In the [[Bible]] a miracle is an act by God, where God's presence is shown. They can be an act that affects one person, or a gigantic disturbance of nature that changes the world.  ===Examples in the Bible=== Here are seven types that can be found. These are just some of the many miracles in the Bible.  ;Gods [[authority]] *Moses parts the [[Red Sea]] so that the people of [[Israel]] could escape from [[Egypt]]<ref name="bibleverse||Exodus|14:1530">{{bibleverse||Exodus|14:1530}}</ref> *[[Jesus]] commands the storm winds to stop blowing<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|8:2225}}</ref> ;Healing *A man crippled since birth gets up and walks after Jesus heals him<ref>{{bibleverse||Mark|2:112}}</ref> *Jesus makes a man who was born [[blind]] to see<ref>{{bibleverse||John|6:115}}</ref> ;[[Judgment]] for evil *People became so [[evil]] that God destroys them with a [[flood]]; [[Noah]] and his family are saved<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|6}}</ref> *Two members of the [[Jerusalem]] church are struck dead for lying<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|5:111}}</ref> ;Provision *God gives [[manna]] to the Israelites as they traveled through the [[desert]]<ref name="bibleverse||Exodus|14:1530"/> *Jesus feeds thousands of people with only five loaves of bread and two fish<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|14:1321}}, {{bibleverse||John|6:115}}</ref> ;Raising the dead *By the power of God, [[Elijah]] raises a widows dead son back to life<ref>{{bibleverse||1|Kings|17:1724}}</ref> *Jesus raises his friend, [[Lazarus]], to life<ref>{{bibleverse||John|11:1744}}</ref> ;Safety *[[Nebuchadnezzar II|King Nebuchadnezzar]] tries to burn [[Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego]] to death in a fiery [[furnace]], but God keeps them from burning<ref>{{bibleverse||Daniel|3}}</ref> ;Visions *The [[prophet]] [[Isaiah]] has a [[vision]] of God seated on his [[throne]] surrounded by angels<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|6:15}}</ref> *[[Paul the Apostle|Saul]] has a vision of Jesus that changed his life<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts|9}}</ref><ref name=ABF>{{cite book|title=The Amazing Bible Factbook|year=2008|publisher=American Bible Society|location=New York|isbn=1603207783|pages=162-167}}</ref>  ==In other books== Other religious books, like the [[Quran]], [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Avesta (religious scripture)|Avesta]], contains many references to this definition of miracle.
