It is native to [[tropics|tropical]] areas from [[South America]], in the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] ([[Brazil]]), but was spread by European farmers to the [[Far East]].  Para Rubber trees belong to the Euphorbiaceae family. In the wild they may reach heights of 100 to 125 [[Foot (unit of length)|ft]] (30-38 m) with large cylindrical trunks with or without [[buttress]]es. Crop trees reach a width of about 20 in. (50 cm), usually with a short [[bole]], and with a sloped [[taper]].   Most rubber [[plantation]]<nowiki/>s are in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. When trees reach 5-6 [[year]]s old, they are [[harvest]]ed. Their trunks are cut just deep enough to tap the vessels without harming the tree's growth, and the [[sap]] is collected in small [[bucket]]s. This process is known as rubber tapping. Older trees produce more latex, but they stop producing it after 30-40 years.  {{Biology-stub}}  [[Category:Euphorbiaceae]]</text>
