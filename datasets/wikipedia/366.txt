It represents a single item. A [[human]] typically has one [[head]], [[nose]], [[mouth]], and [[umbilicus|navel]] (belly-button). The [[Roman numeral]] for ''one'' is I.  == Mathematics == In [[mathematics]], '''1''' is the [[multiplicative identity]] of common numbers.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-03-17|title=List of Arithmetic and Common Math Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/common-math-symbols/|access-date=2020-09-22|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}}</ref> It is sometimes called the "unity".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=1|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/1.html|access-date=2020-09-22|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}}</ref> It is also the only number for which these special facts are true. * Any number ''n'' multiplied by 1 equals that number: ''n''  1 = ''n.'' For example, 7  1 = 7. * Any number ''n'' divided by 1 equals that number: ''n'' / 1 = ''n''. For example, 7 / 1 = 7. * Any number ''n'', other than 0, divided by itself always equals 1: ''n'' / ''n'' = 1. For example: 7 / 7 = 1. * 1 cannot be divided with any other number so that the result is a [[natural number]].  In mathematics, [[0.999...]] is a [[repeating decimal]] that is mathematically equal to 1. Many [[mathematical proof|proofs]] have been made to show this is correct.  == Computer science == The number ''one'' is important for [[computer science]], because the [[binary]] numeral system uses only '''1'''s and '''0'''s. In [[machine code]] and many [[programming language]]s, one means true and zero means false.  == Other meanings == * In [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], one is the grade for "very good". It is the best grade of six possible grades in Germany, and the best of five possible grades in Austria. In the [[Netherlands]], one is the lowest grade, and ten the highest and the best. In [[Poland]], one is also the lowest grade, but the highest is six. * In [[numerology]], the number one is a symbol for everything ([[unity]]), the beginning, and [[God]].  == Related pages ==  * [[Zero]]  == References == <references /> [[Category:Integers]] [[Category:Square numbers]]</text>
