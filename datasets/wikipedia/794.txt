<title>Tone language</title><text>A '''tone language''', or '''tonal language''', is a [[language]] in which [[word]]s can differ in tones (like [[pitch (music)|pitches in music]]) in addition to [[consonants]] and [[vowels]].  Many Asian languages are tone languages, such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. Most languages, including [[Indo-European languages]] like English are not tone languages, but Punjabi is an exception. Moreover, many African languages like [[Yoruba language|Yorb]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Luganda language|Luganda]], [[:en:Ewe_language|Ewe]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]] use tone as well.  In some languages, it is [[Pitch-accent language|pitch accent]] that is important instead. A word's meaning can then change if a different [[syllable]] is stressed. Examples include [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], and some Asian languages like [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. However, pitch accent is different from tones.  Some tones may sound alike to people who do not speak a tone language. They are the most difficult part of learning a tone language for those people.  ==Example== In [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]], the most famous example "''m m m m'' ({{lang|cmn|}})" has four different words each pronounced in exactly the same way but with four different tones. If numbers identify the tones, they can be written m''a1 ma2 ma3 ma4'', which means "mom [[hemp]] [[horse]] scold." Some ways of [[romanization]] mark each tone by a different spelling; ''ma1 ma2 ma3 ma4'' in [[Pinyin]] would be written ''ma mha maa mah'' in [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]]. Most use numbers or [[diacritic|accent marks]] (''m m m m'' in Pinyin). There is a passage called [[:en:Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den|Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den]] ({{lang|zh|}}). It has 92 [[Chinese character|characters]]; all read the same way in Mandarin ("shi") but with different tones.  Mandarin does not have many [[syllable]]s: the words for "mother," "hemp," "horse," "scold," and a word put at the end of sentences to make it a question are all pronounced "ma:" *"Mother" is "ma" that is high and level. *"Hemp" is "ma" that starts low and ends high. *"Horse" is "ma" that starts fairly high, dips very low, and then goes back up again. *"Scold" is "ma" that starts high and ends low. *To make a question, "ma" is added at the end, but it is kept very soft and short and about the same level.  Mandarin has "first tone," "second tone," "third tone," "fourth tone," and "neutral tone." Other Chinese [[dialect]]s have more tones, some as many as twelve.  ==Tonal markings== [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and Pinyin use accents as the tone [[mark]]s for the [[Latin alphabet]]. Each accent shows an altered sound for the [[syllable]]. Most syllables have only one tone marking, but the letters in the syllable can be altered by other markings. Syllables usually form one word in un-[[hyphen]]ated [[compound word|compound]] words.  Pinyin may have style differences because its use is to help Westerners. On the other hand, Vietnamese has a national script that always follows and uses the same style.  [[Category:Tonal languages| ]]</text>
