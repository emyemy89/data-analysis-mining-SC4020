''BBC News Science & Environment''. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-53057055]</ref> Despite this, observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized. This suggests that polarity reversals have occurred in the past. This paleo[[magnetism]]  is similar to the magnetic striping found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory is that these bands suggest [[plate tectonics|plate tectonic activity]] on Mars four [[billion]] years ago, before the planetary [[dynamo]] stopped working and the planet's magnetic field faded.  === Rotation === A Martian day is called a ''sol'', and is a little longer than an Earth day.  Mars rotates in 24 hours and 37 minutes.  It rotates on a tilted axis, just like the Earth does, so it has four different [[season]]s.  Of all the planets in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars are the most Earth-like, due to their similar [[axial tilt]].  The lengths of the Martian seasons are almost twice those of Earth's, as Mars's greater distance from the Sun leads to the Martian year being almost two Earth years long.

During a pole's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]] of 2530% of the atmosphere into slabs of [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] ice ([[dry ice]]). When the poles are again exposed to sunlight, the frozen CO<sub>2</sub> [[Sublimation|sublimes]] (turns to vapor), creating enormous winds that sweep off the poles as fast as 400&nbsp;km/h. Each season this moves large amounts of dust and water vapor, giving rise to Earth-like frost and large [[cirrus cloud]]s and dust storms. Clouds of water-ice were photographed by the ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]'' rover in 2004.  The polar caps at both poles consist primarily of water ice.<ref name=nasa070315/>  === Atmosphere === Mars has a very thin atmosphere with barely any oxygen (it is mostly [[carbon dioxide]]).  Because there is an [[atmosphere]], however thin it is, the sky does change colour when the sun rises and sets.  The dust in the Martian atmosphere makes Martian sunsets somewhat [[blue]].  Mars's atmosphere is too thin to protect Mars from [[meteor]]s, which is part of the reason why Mars has so many craters.  === Meteorite craters === After the formation of the planets, all experienced the "[[Late Heavy Bombardment]]". About 60% of the surface of Mars shows a record of impacts from that era.<ref name=barlow88>Barlow N.G. 1988. Conditions on early Mars: constraints from the cratering record.

Rocks on Earth are sometimes found which have chemicals that are exactly like the ones in Martian rocks. These rocks also look like they fell really quickly through the atmosphere, so it is [[wikt:reasonable|reasonable]] to think they came from Mars.  === Geography === Mars is home to the highest known mountain in the Solar System, [[Olympus Mons]]. Olympus Mons is about 17 miles (or 27 kilometres) high. This is more than three times the height of Earth's tallest mountain, [[Mount Everest]].

The first crude map of Mars was published in 1840, followed by better maps from 1877 onward. Astronomers mistakenly thought they had detected the [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] mark of water in the Martian atmosphere, and the idea of life on Mars became [[wikt:popularise|popular]] among the public.  Yellow clouds on Mars have been observed since the 1870s, which were windblown sand or dust. During the 1920s, the range of Martian surface temperature was measured; it ranged from {{ndash}}85 to 7 <sup>o</sup>C. The planetary atmosphere was found to be arid with only traces of oxygen and water. In 1947, [[Gerard Kuiper]] showed that the thin Martian atmosphere contained extensive [[carbon dioxide]]; roughly double the quantity found in Earth's atmosphere. The first standard naming of Mars surface features was set in 1960 by the [[International Astronomical Union]].  Since the 1960s, multiple robotic [[spacecraft]] and [[rover (space exploration)|rovers]] have been sent to explore Mars from orbit and the surface. The planet has remained under observation by ground and space-based instruments across a broad range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] (visible light, infrared and others). The discovery of [[meteorite]]s on Earth that came from Mars has allowed laboratory examination of the chemical conditions on the planet.  === Martian 'canals' === {{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|width=200|image1=Giovanni map mars.jpg|caption1=Map of Mars by Giovanni Schiaparelli, compiled between 1877 and 1886, showing ''canali'' features as fine lines|alt1=A cylindrical projection map of mars showing light and dark regions accompanied by various linear features.

What caught people's attention was that the maps had features he called ''canali''.  These were later shown to be an [[optical illusion]] (not real). These ''canali'' were supposedly long straight lines on the surface of Mars to which he gave names of famous rivers on Earth. His term ''canali'' was popularly mistranslated in English as ''[[canals]]'', and thought to be made by intelligent beings.<ref name=milone_wilson08>{{cite book | last1=Milone | first1=Eugene F. | last2=Wilson | first2=William J.F. | title=Background science and the inner Solar System | page=228 | volume=1 | series=Solar System Astrophysics | publisher=Springer | year=2008 | isbn=0-387-73154-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CX040NargCEC&pg=PA228 }}</ref><ref name=sagan80>{{cite book | last=Sagan | first=Carl | title=Cosmos | publisher=Random House | year=1980 | page=107 | isbn=0-394-50294-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1gR8lSPrPq4C&pg=PA107 }}</ref>  Other astronomers thought they could see the canals too, especially the American astronomer [[Percival Lowell]] who drew maps of an artificial network of [[canal]]s on Mars.<ref name=lang03>{{cite book | first=Kenneth R. | last=Lang | year=2003  | title=The Cambridge guide to the Solar System | page=251  | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-81306-9  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4xDhVCxAQIC&pg=PA251 }}</ref><ref name=basalla06>{{cite book | first=George | last=Basalla | year=2006  | title=Civilized life in the Universe: scientists on intelligent extraterrestrials | pages=6788  | publisher=Oxford University Press US | isbn=0-19-517181-0  | chapter=Percival Lowell: Champion of Canals  | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oMQIQMmAgoIC&pg=PA67 }}</ref><ref name=isis96>{{cite journal | last1=Maria | first1=K. | last2=Lane | first2=D. | year=2005  | title=Geographers of Mars | journal=Isis | pmid=16536152 | volume=96 | issue=4 | pages=477506 | doi=10.1086/498590 }}</ref><ref name=ba3>{{cite journal | last=Perrotin | first=M. | year=1886  | title=Observations des canaux de Mars  | journal=Bulletin Astronomique, Serie I |volume=3 | pages=324329 | bibcode=1886BuAsI...3..324P | language=French }}</ref><ref name=pasp33>{{cite journal | last=Slipher | first=E.

Today we know that the kind of life, if any, would be some simple [[bacteria]]-type organism.  === Meteorites === [[NASA]] maintains a catalog of 34 Mars [[meteorite]]s, that is, meteorites which originally came from Mars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/index.html|title=Mars Meteorites|accessdate=February 16, 2010|publisher=NASA}}</ref> These assets are highly valuable since they are the only physical samples available of Mars.  Studies at NASA's [[Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Centre]] show that at least three of the meteorites contain possible evidence of past life on Mars, in the form of microscopic structures resembling fossilized bacteria (so-called [[Organism|biomorphs]]). Although the scientific evidence collected is reliable, and the rocks are correctly described, what made the rocks look like they do is not clear. To date, scientists are still trying to agree if it really is evidence of simple life on Mars.<ref name="meteoritos-Bio">[http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/sci/fifthconf99/6142.pdf Evidence for ancient Martian life]. Gibson E. K. Jr. ''et al'' Mail Code SN2, NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston TX 77058, USA.</ref>  Over the past few decades, scientists have agreed that when using meteorites from other planets found on Earth (or rocks brought back to Earth), various things are needed to be sure of life. Those things include:<ref name="meteoritos-Bio"/>  #Did the rock comes from the right time and place on the planet for life to exist?	 #Does the sample contain evidence of [[bacterial]] [[cells]] (does it show fossils of some kind, even if very tiny)? #Is there any evidence of biominerals? ([[minerals]] usually caused by living things) #Is there any evidence of [[isotope]]s typical of life? #Are the features part of the meteorite, and not contamination from Earth?  For people to agree on past life in a geologic sample, most or all of these things must be met. This has not happened yet, but investigations are still in progress.<ref name="meteoritos-Bio"/> Re-examinations of the biomorphs found in the three Martian meteorites are underway.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1001/09marslife/|title=Spaceflight Now - Breaking News - Three Martian meteorites triple evidence for Mars life|website=spaceflightnow.com}}</ref>  === The significance of water === Liquid water is necessary for life and [[metabolism]], so if water was present on Mars, the chances of life evolving is improved. The Viking orbiters found evidence of possible river valleys in many areas, [[erosion]] and, in the southern hemisphere, branched streams.<ref>Strom R.G., Steven K. Croft, and Nadine G. Barlow 1992.

Mitchell Beazley Publishers NY.</ref> Since then, rovers and orbiters have also looked closely and eventually proved water was on the surface at one time, and is still found as ice in the polar ice caps and underground.  === Today === So far, scientists have not found life on Mars, either living or [[extinct]]. Several [[space probe]]s have gone to Mars to study it. Some have [[orbit]]ed (gone around) the planet, and some have landed on it. There are pictures of the surface of Mars that were sent back to Earth by the probes. Some people are interested in sending [[astronaut]]s to visit Mars. They could do a better search, but getting astronauts there would be difficult and expensive. The astronauts would be in space for many years, and it could be very dangerous because of [[radiation]] from the sun.  So far we have only sent unmanned probes.  The most recent probe to the planet is the [[Mars Science Laboratory]].  It landed on [[Aeolis Palus]] in Gale Crater on Mars on 6 August 2012.<ref name ="Space-20120806">{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Touchdown!
