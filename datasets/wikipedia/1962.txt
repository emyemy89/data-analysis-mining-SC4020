It is a [[sovereign state]] in the south-western part of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is made up of two large [[island]]s (the [[North Island]] and the [[South Island]]) and many smaller islands. These islands are located to the southeast of [[Australia]]. New Zealand was one of the last places in the world that humans discovered, because it is a long way away from most of the world. During its time without humans, New Zealand was a good place for an unusual range of plants and animals to develop.  The [[capital city]] of the country is [[Wellington]], and the largest city is [[Auckland]]. Both of these cities are on the North Island. The largest city on the South Island is [[Christchurch]].  The [[official language]]s are [[English language|English]], [[Mori language|Mori]] and [[sign language|New Zealand sign language]]. English has never been granted official language status in the NZ laws,  but it is used as a default official language due to its wide usage.  In 2010, a newspaper in NZ said that New Zealand was the 8th happiest country in the world.<ref>{{cite web  |url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10656485|title = NZ eighth happiest country in the world|work = nzherald.co.nz|accessdate = 17 July 2015}}</ref>  == Name == In the [[Mori language]], the country is called Aotearoa, which means "Land of the Long White Cloud". ''Ao'' means cloud, ''tea'' means white, and ''roa'' means long. The name "New Zealand" comes from Zeeland (which translates to "Sealand") in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], after the islands were seen by Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]]. [[Zeeland]] is a [[province]] of the [[Netherlands]].   == Government and politics == New Zealand is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and parliamentary [[democracy]]. The [[head of state]] is [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. The [[Prime Minister]] is [[Jacinda Ardern]], leader of the Labour Party.  New Zealand has made itself a ''Nuclear Free Zone'': They do not use [[nuclear power]] and do not allow [[nuclear weapon]]s or nuclear powered vessels in their territory.  Elections are held every 3 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.govt.nz/browse/engaging-with-government/government-in-new-zealand/|title=How government works|website=New Zealand Government|language=en-NZ|access-date=2018-12-13}}</ref>  == People == As of the 2018 census, 4,699,755 people lived in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Place Summaries {{!}} New Zealand {{!}} Stats NZ|url=https://www.stats.govt.nz/tools/2018-census-place-summaries/new-zealand|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=15/10/2020|work=stats.govt.nz}}</ref> Most of them have [[Europe]]an [[ancestor]]s.<ref name="race">{{cite web  |url= http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2006CensusHomePage/QuickStats/quickstats-about-a-subject/culture-and-identity/ethnic-groups-in-new-zealand.aspx  |title=QuickStats About Culture and Identity - Statistics New Zealand  |work=stats.govt.nz  |accessdate=4 July 2010 }}</ref> The indigenous people of New Zealand, the [[Mori people|Mori]], have a population of 775,836, or 16.5%.  The people of New Zealand often call themselves Kiwis. This name is derived from the [[kiwi]], a flightless native [[bird]] that is considered the country's national bird.   The North Island is smaller than the South Island, but most people (more than 3 million) live there. This might be because the North Island is usually warmer, and has more big cities.  About half of the people in New Zealand are religious. As of the 2018 census, 48.2% had no religion. The main religion in New Zealand is [[Christianity]]. Just over 2 million New Zealanders are Christian.<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2006CensusHomePage/QuickStats/quickstats-about-a-subject/culture-and-identity/religious-affiliation.aspx  |title=QuickStats About Culture and Identity - Statistics New Zealand  |work=stats.govt.nz  |accessdate=4 July 2010  |archive-date=3 April 2013  |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Fc6Twaqe?url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2006CensusHomePage/QuickStats/quickstats-about-a-subject/culture-and-identity/religious-affiliation.aspx  |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The second most common religion is Hinduism, with 2.6%.   == Cities == Most New Zealanders live in urban areas, with the other 27% living in small towns or farming communities.  [[Wellington]] is the [[capital (city)|capital]] of New Zealand. [[Auckland]] is the largest [[city]], with around 1 million people. Other cities in the North Island include [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], [[Tauranga]], Napier/Hastings, [[:en:New_Plymouth|New Plymouth]], [[:en:Whanganui|Whanganui]], and Palmerston North. South Island cities include [[Christchurch, New Zealand|Christchurch]], [[Dunedin]], [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], [[Invercargill]] and Timaru.  == Geological origin == [[File:NZ_faults.png|thumb|250px|Major [[Fault (geology)|fault]] zones of New Zealand. It shows how the Pacific and Australian plates move against each other.]] New Zealand sits at the boundary between the Australian and Pacific [[Plate tectonics|continental plates]]. When these two plates bumped into each other ('collided'), the Pacific plate moved under the Australian plate, north of the South Island. As a result, there has been lots of [[volcano|volcanic]] activity. South of the South Island, the Australian plate moves under the Pacific plate instead. The plates slide past each other in the South Island, where they have pushed up the [[Southern Alps]].  Because of these two colliding plates, New Zealand often has [[earthquakes]]. One of the best known is the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake (February)|2010-2011 group of earthquakes]] that hit the Christchurch area.   The diagram shows that the North Island is on the Australian plate, but most of the South Island is on the Pacific plate. New Zealand is still geologically active, and will remain so as long as the islands are sitting above the plate boundary.<ref>Graham, Ian J. et al. 2008.

New Zealand became part of the global [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]]. When that split (End-[[Triassic]]/early [[Jurassic]]), New Zealand became part of the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]]. Finally Gondwana broke up, leaving the continents rather as they are today.   == Natural history == New Zealand was isolated from the rest of the world for a long time. It split from Australia 83 million years ago. Because of this, there are many [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s that only live in New Zealand. Before humans came to New Zealand, there were no [[mammal]]s, except three species of [[bat]] and marine mammals such as [[Pinniped|seals]], [[dolphin]]s, and [[whale]]s. Instead, New Zealand has many different kinds of bird. New Zealand has several species of flightless bird, including the [[kiwi]] and [[Kakapo]]. For the lizards, especially important is the [[Tuatara]], the only living member of a whole [[Order (biology)|order]] of reptiles.  New Zealand used to have more rare species, but some, mostly birds, were hunted to [[extinction]] early in its history. The giant [[Moa]], ''[[Dinornis]]'', is a famous example. The group of birds which the moa belongs to had been in existence since the [[Cretaceous]] period. Humans arrived in New Zealand about a thousand years ago, when many moa were living, especially on the South Island. [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] sites with evidence of moa hunting are all over New Zealand. The moa became [[extinct]] about five hundred years ago.<ref>Martin P.S. and Klein R.G. (eds) ''Quaternary extinctions: a prehistoric revolution''. University of Arizona Press, Tucson AZ.</ref> Extinctions closer to today have been caused by [[habitat]] change and introduced [[species]] like [[rat]]s, [[dog]]s, cats, and possums, which kill the native birds and lizards, or eat their eggs.  == Other information ==  * Sir [[Edmund Hillary]], the first man to climb to the top of [[Mount Everest]], was from New Zealand. * New Zealand has become more [[Popularity|popular]] since New Zealander [[Peter Jackson]] made the [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''The Lord of the Rings'' movies]] there. * Many farmers in New Zealand breed [[sheep]]. There are many more sheep than people in New Zealand. * Many New Zealanders are interested in [[sport]]s. Their national sport is usually considered to be [[Rugby football|rugby]] (in winter). They have impressive [[Sportsperson|athletes]] in [[rowing]], [[cycling]], [[shotput]], [[discus]], [[iron man]], [[triathlon]], [[yachting]], [[climbing]], [[surfing]], [[cricket]], [[netball]], [[softball]], [[wind surfing]], [[gliding]], and more. * New Zealanders enjoy [[outdoor]] pursuits.

New Zealand has a wide variety of musicians, television, and radio celebrities, and stand-up comedians. Although most are simply "world-famous in New Zealand", many others have successfully made it on the international scene. Such people and groups include [[Russell Crowe]] (actor), [[Kiri Te Kanawa]] (singer), the [[Flight of the Conchords]], [[Lorde]], [[Crowded House]] (bands/singers), [[Lee Tamahori]], [[Taika Waititi|Taika Waititi,]] and [[Peter Jackson]] (movie directors). * The NZ Army mostly does peacekeeping and natural disaster support.
