Earthquakes' effects were once measured after the [[Mercalli scale]], which regards the practical damages that a seismic event causes to infrastructures and houses, and a sort of comparison between the two scale is now in use, especially for ancient events.''  == Other websites == *[http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/bulletin/ USGS list of current earthquakes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050123011344/http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/bulletin/ |date=2005-01-23 }} *[http://earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/index-eng.php Earthquakes Canada] *[http://www.geonet.org.nz/recent_quakes.html Recent New Zealand earthquakes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321023239/http://www.geonet.org.nz/recent_quakes.html |date=2007-03-21 }}  {{DEFAULTSORT:earthquakes}} [[Category:Earthquakes|*]] [[Category:Science-related lists]]</text>
