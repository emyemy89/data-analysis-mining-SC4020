The area of Turkey is about {{convert|780000|sqkm}}.  Turkey is a [[republic]]. There are 81 provinces in Turkey. The money of Turkey is called [[Turkish Lira]]. The capital city is [[Ankara]], a city in the central region, called [[Anatolia]]. The cultural and economic center is in the European side of [[Istanbul]]. In the past Istanbul was called [[Constantinople]]. The republic was founded in 1923, after [[World War I]] and a war of independence (''Kurtulu Sava''). Before that, Turkey was the core of the [[Ottoman Empire]].  Many civilizations were in the area that is now Turkey, like the [[Hittites]], the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]].  Many important events in the history of Christianity happened in places that are now in Turkey.  Because it lies in both Europe and Asia, some people see Turkey as the "door" between them.   Modern Turkey's warm and varied [[climate]] lets many kinds of food crops grow, and livestock and [[forestry]] are important industries. Turkey makes enough food to feed itself. Turkish manufactures include airplanes, [[electronics]], [[car]]s, [[clothes|clothing]] and textiles for home and for other countries.  Turkey is a popular place for tourists to visit. It has hundreds of kilometers of beautiful beaches on its [[Aegean]] and [[Mediterranean]] coasts, and many important historical places.  == History == === Ancient Anatolia === People have been living in [[Anatolia]] (the Asian part of Turkey - also called [[Asia Minor]]) longer than almost anywhere else in the world, except Africa.  The first major empire in the area was the [[Hittites]] (from the 18th century to the 13th century BC). The Hittites, who spoke one of the [[Indo-European languages]], developed a high culture in Central Anatolia. Their kingdom was destroyed by the [[Cimmerians]] in the 7th century BC and the successor states were [[Lydia]], Caria and Lycia.  From 1950 [[BCE]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]s and [[Assyrian]]s inhabited parts of southeastern Turkey. The Assyrian capital was named Tushhan (900-600 BC). The Assyrians ruled over southeastern Turkey until the Assyrian Empire was conquered by [[Babylonia]] in the year 612 BC. Then [[Anatolia]] became home for various kingdoms including the [[Achaemenid Empire]], [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic kingdoms]], [[Roman Empire]], [[Byzantine Empire]] (Eastern Roman Empire), [[Seljuk Empire]], and [[Mongol Empire]].  === The Ottoman Empire === {{Main article|Ottoman Empire}} During the 14th century, after the fall of the [[Mongol Empire]], Lord Osman built a new empire named after himself: the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It became one of the longest existing empires of all time. The Empire also stretched across the [[Balkans]], ([[Yugoslavia]] and [[Bulgaria]]) in [[Europe]]. The Kingdom was ruled by Muslim law, but other religions had certain [[minority rights]].  In [[World War I]] the Ottoman Empire was one of the [[Central Powers]]. During the war, 500,000 [[Armenians]] in the Ottoman Empire were massacred in the so-called [[Armenian Genocide]]. Turkey denies that the event was genocide. The Central Powers lost the war and the Ottoman Empire was destroyed, but after that [[Atatrk]] led the army to get rid of foreign enemies, like the Greeks.  === Republic of Turkey === [[Mustafa Kemal Atatrk]] was the first [[President of Turkey]]. He made many changes that made Turkey more modern. But some people did not like some of the changes that made life in Turkey more secular. Religious secondary schools were gotten rid of, for example. The opponents to Atatrk felt that he weakened [[Islam]] in the country. Later political disputes led to [[Coup d'tat]] in 1960, 1971, and 1980, and several failed attempts.  For many years [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[guerrilla]]s of the Kurdistan Workers Party (known as the PKK; {{Lang-tr|Krdistan i Partisi}}) have been fighting the Turkish government. The PKK is a [[nationalist]] and [[separatist]] movement led by [[Abdullah calan]]. Their aim is for the [[Kurd]]s in the southeast of Turkey to have [[autonomy]], with a government of their own. Because they use armed conflict, the Turkish government calls them [[terrorist]]s. The European Union and United States also call them terrorists.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20971100|title=Who are Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) rebels?|date=4 November 2016|access-date=2019-04-08|language=en-GB}}</ref>  On 15 July 2016, a [[coup d'tat]] was [[2016 Turkish coup d'tat attempt|attempted]].  == People == [[File:Yagli gures1.jpg|thumb|Oil-wrestling at Krkpnar]] About 80 million people live in Turkey. Most of them are [[ethnic]] [[Turkish people|Turks]]. About 15% are ethnic [[Kurd]]s. Many [[refugee]]s from [[Syria]] (over 3 million) live in Turkey because they have run away from the [[Syrian civil war]]. Many [[Romani people]] live in [[Istanbul]] and [[Edirne]] (European part of Turkey).  The vast majority of Turks are [[Muslim]] and Male [[Circumcision]] is a big Festival. The biggest city in Turkey is Istanbul which has the biggest population of any city in Europe.  Turkish people have many ethnic and famous foods, such as [[mant]] (Turkish [[ravioli]]), [[dner]], [[kebab]]s, Turkish delight, baklava, brek, kfte, and other foods.  Much of the population in Turkey is made up of teenagers and young adults.  According to a study, Anatolia is [[genetics|genetically]] more closely related to the [[Balkans|Balkan]] populations than to the Central Asian populations. The Turks of [[Anatolia]] (Asian part of Turkey) have only 13% of genes from populations from [[Central Asia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18161848|title = Alu insertion polymorphisms and an assessment of the genetic contribution of Central Asia to Anatolia with respect to the Balkans.|date = May 2008|website = National Center for Biotechnology Information|publisher = Berkman CC1, Dinc H, Sekeryapan C, Togan I,}}</ref> The population is mainly from the [[Greeks]], [[Armenians]] and [[Kurds]].  == European Union == Some people have wanted Turkey to join the [[European Union|European Union (EU)]] since the 1990s.  == Economy == Turkey is in the [[OECD]] and the G-20 and is one of the 20 largest economies. The Turkish currency is called the Lira. The first coins were made in Turkey.  In the 1970s, many Turks moved to other countries, like Germany, to escape the bad economy at the time and to get better jobs. They often come back to Turkey for summer holidays. Today, many of the people who left in the 1970s want to move back to Turkey.  Until the 1980s the government owned most companies, but then Prime Minister Turgut zal sold them. Before, foreigners were usually not allowed to buy companies, land or property. Turkey's [[international trade]] is mostly with the [[EU]], the United States, the Russian Federation, and Japan. Turkey and the EU agreed not to put a lot of tax on what they buy and sell to each other. After that it was easier for Turkish factories to sell products to the EU and for business people in the EU to buy companies in Turkey.  Turkey's exports in 2010 were worth 117 billion [[United States dollar]]s.  Earthquakes in 1994, 1999, and 2001 slowed economic growth a bit. Turkey has no [[petroleum]] or natural gas so it buys them from other countries, like Russia. In 2010, oil was found in the Turkish City of Diyarbakir, but there was not enough oil to extract. Turkey is searching for natural gas in Turkish [[Northern Cyprus]].  == Provinces == The [[capital city|capital]] and second-largest city of Turkey is [[Ankara]]. The largest and the most crowded city is [[Istanbul]] which is the only city in the world that has land on two different continents. The third largest city is the coastal city of [[Izmir]] which is the main port of the country. Turkey is divided into 81 provinces. Each province has its own little government but they can only make decisions about small things: the government in Ankara decides important issues. The provinces are in 7 regions. Each province is divided into districts. There are 973 districts altogether.  == Culture == === Language === {{main|Turkish language}} Most people in Turkey speak [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. It belongs to the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] group, which also includes many other languages spoken across [[Asia]], such as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and [[Tatar language|Tatar]]. The Turkish language came from central Asia, but now it is a bit different from the languages spoken in [[central Asia]]. Turks living by the Mediterranean have southern, much thicker, and more masculine accents than western Turkey. Northerners, by the Black Sea have softer accents.  In Turkey there are also [[minority|minorities]] who speak languages such as [[Arabic]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Ladino language|Ladino]], and many others.  Many of the young adults can also speak English, which is taught throughout Primary, Middle and High school.  === Lifestyle === Turkish culture is a modern Islamic culture, with some European influence.  Different parts of Turkey have similar but not exactly the same lifestyles. Central Turkey is somewhat more traditional. Western Turkey, especially coastal cities are more modern and secular. Eastern and Southeastern Turkey is made up of mostly [[Kurds]].  Rich cities in Turkey include [[Istanbul]], [[zmir]], [[Konya]], [[Ankara]], [[Mersin]] (also known as el), and [[Antalya]].  === Majority and minorities === The majority of Turkey is made up of Turks. The largest minority is [[Kurdish people|Kurds]]. Kurds live mostly in South Eastern and Eastern Turkey. The second largest minority are [[Arab]]s.  == Education == {{main|Education in Turkey}} Turkey's [[literacy]] rate is currently 95%. People in Turkey have to go to school for 12 years.  [[stanbul University]] was the first university in Turkey. It was established in 1453. [[Ankara University]] was the first university that was started after Turkey became a republic. It was established in 1946.  There were 6065 high schools in Turkey in 2002 according to Ministry of National Education.<sup>[http://www.meb.gov.tr/Stats/Apk2002/61.htm]</sup> {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125162721/http://www.meb.gov.tr/Stats/Apk2002/61.htm |date=2011-11-25 }} In 2011, there were 166 universities in Turkey.<ref>[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&n=university-numbers-on-the-rise-in-turkey-2011-09-04 University numbers on the rise in Turkey] (Hrriyet Daily News, 4 September 2011)</ref>  == Earthquakes == The [[1999 zmit earthquake]] was an approximately 7.4 magnitude earthquake that struck northwestern Turkey on 17 August 1999, at about 3:02 am local time. 18.000 people died in the earthquake.
