<title>Arabian Peninsula</title><text>[[ Image: Empty quarter Arabia.PNG | thumb | right | 250px | The Arabian Peninsula]]   The '''Arabian Peninsula''' or '''Arabia'''<ref>The term "Arabia" is used for the peninsula viewed as a geopolitical region.</ref> is a [[peninsula]] in [[Southwest Asia]] at the junction of [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]. It lies east of [[Ethiopia]] and northern [[Somalia]]; south of [[Israel]], the disputed [[Palestine|Palestinian]] territories, and [[Jordan]]; and southwest of [[Iran]]. [[File:Arabian_peninsula_definition.PNG | thumb |250px]] [[File:ArabianPlate.png|thumb|250px|The Arabian plate]] [[File:Ottoman empire.svg|The [[Ottoman Empire]]|thumb|250px]]  The waters around Arabia are: on the southwest the [[Red Sea]] and [[Gulf of Aqaba]]; on the southeast the [[Arabian Sea]]; and on the northeast the [[Gulf of Oman]] and the [[Persian Gulf]].   Arabia includes the countries of: *[[Saudi Arabia]] *[[Yemen]] *[[Oman]] *[[Kuwait]] *[[United Arab Emirates]] *[[Qatar]] *[[Bahrain]]  The peninsula is part of the [[Middle East]], but that usually means the Arabian Peninsula with the [[Levant]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. The word "Arabia" often refers only to Saudi Arabia.  The country of Saudi Arabia covers almost all of Arabia. The majority of the population of the peninsula live in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Northern Arabia has important [[oil well]]s. [[Climate change]] and the scarcity of [[water]] has affected the whole of this area.<ref>Roberts, Patrick ''etc'' 2018.

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0698-9]</ref> Water has become scarcer because human numbers have grown greatly. Most rivers are tapped in their upper reaches, which reduces water in the lower reaches of the rivers.  == Geography/geology == The Arabian Plate is a minor [[tectonic plate]] in the northern and eastern hemispheres. The most prominent feature of the peninsula is the [[desert]]. In the southwest there are mountain ranges. These get more rain than the rest of the peninsula.   == References == {{reflist}}  == Related pages ==  * [[History of Arabia]]  == Other websites ==  *[http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11767/ Arabia] British Foreign Office, 1920 {{authority control}}  [[Category:Peninsulas]] [[Category:Arabia]] [[Category:Gondwana]]</text>
