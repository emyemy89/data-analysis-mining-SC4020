<title>Internet</title><text>The '''Internet''' is the biggest world-wide communication [[network]] of computers. The Internet has millions of smaller domestic, [[academic]], [[business]], and [[government]] networks, which together carry many different kinds of [[information]]. The short form of internet is the 'net'. The [[World Wide Web]] is one of its biggest services. It is used by billions of people all over the world. [[File:DARPA Logo 2010.png|thumb|Logo of [[DARPA]], an organization funded by the US government, which helped develop the Internet]] The Internet was developed in the United States by the "[[United States Department of Defense]] Advanced Research Projects Agency" ([[DARPA]]). The Internet was first connected in October of 1969<ref>{{Cite web  |url= http://www.walthowe.com/navnet/history.html  |title=A brief history of the internet  |work=walthowe.com  |accessdate=13 July 2010 }}</ref> and was called [[ARPANET]]. The World Wide Web was created at [[CERN]] in [[Switzerland]] in 1990 by a [[United Kingdom|British]] ([[UK]]) [[scientist]] named [[Tim Berners-Lee]].  Today, people can pay [[money]] to access the Internet from [[internet service provider]]s. Some services on the Internet cost nothing to use. Sometimes people who offer these free services use [[advertising]] to make money. Censorship and [[freedom of speech]] on the Internet can be controversial.  == Services on the Internet == The Internet is used for many things, such as [[E-mail|electronic mail]], [[online chat]], [[computer file|file]] transfer and other documents of the [[World Wide Web]].  The most used service on the Internet is the [[World Wide Web]] (which is also called the "Web" or www). The web contains [[website]]s, including [[blog]]s and [[wiki]]s like [[Wikipedia]]. [[Webpage]]s on the Internet can be seen and read by anyone (unless the page needs a [[password]], or it is blocked).  The second biggest use of the Internet is to send and receive e-mail. E-mail is private and goes from one [[:wikt:user|user]] to another. [[Instant messaging]] is similar to email, but allows two or more people to chat to each other faster.  Some governments think the internet is a bad thing, and block all or part of it.  For example, the Chinese government thinks that Wikipedia is bad, so often no one in [[China]] can read it or add to it.<ref>{{cite web|author=posted by abennett|first=|date=2004-06-14|title=Chinese censors block access to Wikipedia|url=http://www.itworld.com/040614wikipedia|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629134343/http://www.itworld.com/040614wikipedia|archive-date=2013-06-29|accessdate=2009-10-16|website=|publisher=ITworld}}</ref> Another example of the internet being blocked is in [[North Korea]].<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Rapport @ 09 GB|url=http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Internet_enemies_2009_2_.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316065534/http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Internet_enemies_2009_2_.pdf|archive-date=March 16, 2009|accessdate=2009-10-16|website=|format=PDF}}</ref> Some [[parent]]s and schools block parts of the Internet they think are bad for [[child]]ren to see.  ==  Dangers on the Internet == The Internet makes communication easy, and communication can be dangerous too. People often send secret information, and sometimes other people can steal that information. They can use the Internet to spread lies or stolen secrets or dangerously bad advice. For example, [[Facebook]] has had some problems with [[privacy]] settings.    * Some websites may trick people into [[download]]ing [[computer virus|viruses]] that can harm a computer, or [[spyware]] that [[spy|spies]] on its users (looks at what they are doing and tells someone else).  *E-mails can have harmful files with them as "attachments".<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Internet Safety: Internet 101 - Viruses, worms and Trojans|url=http://www.wiredsafety.org/internet101/viruses.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130705180116/https://www.wiredsafety.org/internet101/viruses.html|archive-date=2013-07-05|accessdate=2009-10-16|website=|publisher=Wiredsafety.org}}</ref> * In [[IRC|internet chatrooms]], people might be preying on others or trying to [[stalking|stalk]] or [[abuse]] them. * The Internet contains content that many people find [[offensive]] , as well as content intended to be offensive. * Criminals may [[Identity theft|steal people's personal information]] or [[Internet fraud|trick people into sending them money]].  {{Commons category|Internet}}  == References == {{reflist}}  == Related pages == *[[Media studies]] *[[World Wide Web]] *[[ARPANET]]  [[Category:Internet| ]]</text>
