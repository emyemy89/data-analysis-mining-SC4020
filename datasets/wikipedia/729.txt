<title>Wikipedia:Rules</title><text>{{pp-semi|small=yes}} {{policy|WP:RULES|WP:POLICY|WP:POL|WP:GUIDE|WP:RULE}} Any time that people work together, it is important to make rules that they should agree to follow. Most of the rules written here must be followed by everyone, and some of the rules are still being decided.  Most of the time, if a rule has not been made here, or if something that happens is not covered by the rules that are here, we will look at the [[:en:Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|rules on the main English Wikipedia]] or other Wikimedia projects. We should also use common sense.  == [[meta:Foundation issues|Foundation issues]] == The [[meta:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] has made rules that can never be changed. All projects must follow them: * [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]] is the most important rule in changing pages. * Anyone can change articles without making a username. * The "wiki process" is the way to decide what is put on the project. See [[WP:CONSENSUS]].  * All writing is available by [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyleft licensing]].
