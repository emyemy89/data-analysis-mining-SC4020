There were 640,932 people living in the city in 2015, and more than 2,000,000 people living in the [[Clark County, Nevada|metropolitan area]]. It is the largest city in Nevada. Las Vegas is also the [[county seat]] of Clark County. [[Carolyn Goodman (politician)|Carolyn Goodman]] became the mayor in 2011.Las Vegas and Las Vegans are often stereotypically characterized as fun-loving. == Politics == Las Vegas leans to the left. 3 of the 4 congressional districts in Nevada include parts of Las Vegas, and all three congresspeople representing those districts are a.) from Las Vegas and b.) Democrats. == History == [[Native Americans]], the Paiute tribe, first lived there. It was called ''Las Vegas'' by the Spanish. The name means ''The [[Meadow]]s'' in the [[Spanish language]]. They had a lot of these in [[1854]]. The city is known for its dry weather, as is the rest of southern [[Nevada]]. It is surrounded by [[desert]]s.   The [[US Army]] built Fort Baker there in [[1864]]. Las Vegas has [[Spring (water)|springs]] so people used to stop there for [[water]] when they were going to [[Los Angeles]] or other places in [[California]].  In [[1905]], 110 acres owned by William A. Clark, on which he built a [[railroad]] to Southern [[California]] were [[auction]]ed and Las Vegas was founded as a railroad [[town]]. Las Vegas officially became a city in [[1911]]. {{reflist}}  {{Nevada}} {{USLargestCities}} [[File:Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas.jpg|center|thumb|454x454px|The well-known Welcome to the Fabulous Las Vegas Sign. ]] {{authority control}} [[Category:Las Vegas, Nevada| ]] [[Category:County seats in Nevada]] [[Category:1905 establishments in the United States]] [[Category:20th-century establishments in Nevada]]</text>
