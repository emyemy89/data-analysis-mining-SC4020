Some are grown as [[ornamental plant]]s, or for their [[fibre]]s.  There are about 110 different species of banana. In [[popular culture]] and [[commerce]], "banana" usually refers to the soft and sweet kind, also known as ''dessert bananas''. Other kinds, or [[Cultivar|cultivars]], of banana have a firmer, [[Starch|starchier]] fruit. Those are usually called [[plantain]]s. Plantains are mostly used for cooking or fibre.  Other than being used as food, [[beer]] can be made by [[fermentation|fermenting]] the [[juice]] of certain [[cultivar]]s in Africa, known as ''beer bananas''.<ref name="unctad">{{cite web|url=http://www.unctad.org/infocomm/anglais/banana/Doc/musa.pdf|title=Uses of Musa|year=1996|publisher=UNCTAD|format=pdf|access-date=2009-08-05|archive-date=2009-02-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220022212/http://unctad.org/infocomm/anglais/banana/Doc/musa.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[ash]] of bananas can be used to make [[soap]].<ref name="unctad" /> In Asia, bananas are often planted to provide shade to plants that like shade, for example [[coffee]], [[cocoa]], [[nutmeg]] or [[black pepper]].<ref name="unctad" /> Because of this, banana plants can often be found in [[plantation]]s of other crops.  ==Banana plant== The banana plant is the largest [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] flowering plant.<ref>[http://www.rhs.org.uk/Learning/Publications/pubs/garden0502/ ''Yes, we have more bananas''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531001001/http://www.rhs.org.uk/Learning/Publications/pubs/garden0502/ |date=2009-05-31 }} [[wikt:publish|published]] in the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] Journals, May 2002</ref> Banana plants are often mistaken for [[tree]]s. Bananas have a ''false stem'' (called ''pseudostem''), which is made by the lower part of the leaves. This pseudostem can grow to be two to eight meters tall. Each pseudostem grows from a [[corm]]. A pseudostem is able to produce a single bunch of bananas. After fruiting, the pseudostem dies and is replaced. When most bananas are [[ripe]], they turn [[yellow]] or, sometimes, [[red]]. Unripe bananas are green.

The fruits grow in rows called ''tiers'' or ''hands''. There can be as many as twenty fruits to a hand, and as many as twenty tiers in a bunch. A bunch usually weighs between 30 and 50 kilograms (65 to 110 pounds).  A single fruit weighs about 125 grams (4.4 ounces) on average; about three quarters of this is water.   Each banana (or ''finger'') has a protective outer layer (called ''peel'' or ''skin''). There is a fleshy part inside that readily spilts into three segments. It is the only known tri-segmented fruit in the world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Both the skin and inner part can be eaten.

There are two basic forms of these allergies. The first is known as [[oral allergy syndrome]]. Within an hour of eating a banana, [[swelling]] starts inside the mouth or throat. This allergy is related to allergies caused by [[pollen]], like that of the [[birch]] tree. The other is similar to [[latex allergy|latex allergies]]. It causes [[urticaria]] and potentially serious upper [[gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] symptoms.<ref>{{cite web|title="The Informall Database: Communicating about Food Allergies - General Information for Banana"|url=http://foodallergens.ifr.ac.uk/food.lasso?selected_food=5|accessdate=2007-04-29|archive-date=2018-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308235454/http://foodallergens.ifr.ac.uk/food.lasso?selected_food=5|url-status=dead}}</ref>  ==Other uses of bananas==  ===Textiles=== The fibre gained from the banana plant has been used to make [[textile]]s for a long time. In [[Japan]], bananas have been grown to be used for [[clothes|clothing]] and in the house since at least the [[13th century]]. In the Japanese system, the leaves and shoots are cut from the plant periodically to make sure they are soft. The harvested shoots must first be boiled in [[lye]] to prepare the fibres for the making of the [[yarn]]. These banana shoots produce fibres of varying degrees of softness. They can be used for yarns and textiles of different qualties, and for specific uses. For example, the outermost fibres of the shoots are the coarsest - they are good for [[tablecloth]]s. The softest innermost fibres are desirable for [[kimono]] and [[hakama|kamishimo]]. This traditional Japanese banana cloth making process has many steps, all performed by hand.<ref>{{cite web |title =Traditional Crafts of Japan - Kijoka Banana Fiber Cloth |publisher = Association for the Promotion of Traditional Craft Industries |url = http://www.kougei.or.jp/english/crafts/0130/f0130.html |accessdate = 11-12-2006}}</ref>  Another system is used in [[Nepal]]. There the [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] of the banana plant is harvested instead. Small pieces of this trunk are then softened. The fibres are extracted mechanically, [[bleach]]ed, and [[drying|dried]]. They are then sent to the [[Kathmandu Valley]], where high-end [[rug]]s are produced. These rugs have a texture and general qualities similar to that of [[silk]]. These banana fibre rugs are woven by traditional Nepalese hand-knotted methods.  ==== What are the benefits of bananas ==== A medium-sized '''banana''' will provide around 320-400 mg of potassium, which meets about 10% of your daily potassium needs. Potassium helps your body maintain a healthy heart and blood pressure. In addition, '''bananas''' are low in sodium. The low sodium and high potassium combination helps to control high blood pressure.  === Paper=== <!-- {{Main|Banana paper}} --> Banana fiber is also used to make ''banana paper''. There are two different kinds of banana paper: paper made from the [[bark]], and paper made from the fibre and from unused fruits.  == Images == <gallery> Image:Bananier-Jardin-Etat-1.jpg|[[Flower]] of a banana plant.This image was taken in the state botanical gardens on the [[island]] of [[La Reunion]] File:Banana.plant.kewgardens.arp.jpg|Banana plant at [[Kew Gardens]] in [[London]] File:Bananas - Morocco.jpg|Bananas on a plantation in Morocco Image:Inside a wild-type banana.jpg|Fruits of wild-type bananas have many large, hard seeds. </gallery>  ==Related pages== *[[Banana bread]]  ==References== {{reflist|2}}  == Other websites == {{wikt}} * {{commonscat-inline}} * {{Cite web |url= http://www.ssrichardmontgomery.com/download/bananas.htm |title=bananas |work=ssrichardmontgomery.com |accessdate=3 June 2010}} * {{Cite web |url= http://healthmad.com/nutrition/banana-beneficial-for-human/ |title=Banana: Beneficial for Human |work=healthmad.com |accessdate=3 June 2010}}  {{Fruits}}  [[Category:Fruits]] [[Category:Musaceae]]</text>
