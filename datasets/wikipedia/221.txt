<title>Hydrogen</title><text>{{Infobox hydrogen}} '''Hydrogen''' is a [[chemical element|chemical element.]] It has the symbol '''H''' and [[atomic number]] 1.  It has a [[standard atomic weight]] of 1.008, meaning it is the lightest element in the [[periodic table]].   Hydrogen is the most common chemical element in the [[Universe]], making up 75% of all normal ([[baryon|baryonic)]] matter (by [[mass]]). Most [[stars]] are mostly hydrogen. Hydrogen's most common [[isotope]] has one [[proton]] with one [[electron]] [[Atomic orbital|orbiting]] around it.  == Properties == Hydrogen is classed as a [[reactive nonmetal]], unlike the other elements appearing in the first column of the [[periodic table]], which are classed [[alkali metal]]s. The solid form of hydrogen is expected to behave like a metal, however.  When alone, hydrogen usually [[chemical bond|binds]] with itself to make '''dihydrogen''' (H<sub>2</sub>) which is very stable, due to its high bond dissociation energy of 435.7 kJ/mol<ref>{{cite book  | editor-last = Lide | editor-first = David R.  | date = 2006  | title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics  | page = {{{page|}}}  | pages = {{{pages|}}}  | edition = 87th  | publisher = [[CRC Press]]  | location = Boca Raton, FL  | isbn = 0-8493-0487-3 }}</ref>. At standard temperature and pressure, this hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) has no colour, smell or taste. It is not toxic. It is a nonmetal and burns very easily.  === Combustion === Molecular hydrogen is flammable and reacts with oxygen:  2 H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g)  2 H<sub>2</sub>O(l) + 572 kJ (286 kJ/mol)  At temperatures above 500 degrees Celsius, hydrogen spontaneously ignites in air.  === Compounds === While hydrogen gas in its pure form is not reactive, it does form compounds with many elements, particularly [[halogens]], which are very electronegative. Hydrogen also forms vast arrays with [[carbon]] atoms, forming [[hydrocarbons]]. The study of the properties of hydrocarbons are known as [[organic chemistry]].   The H<sup>-</sup> anion (negatively charged atom) is called a hydride, although the term is not widely used. An example of a hydride is lithium hydride (LiH), which is used as a "spark plug" in nuclear weapons.  === Acids === [[Acid]]s dissolved in water typically contain high levels of hydrogen ions, in other words, free [[protons]]. The level of them is usually used to determine its pH, which basically means the content of hydrogen ions in a particular volume. For example, [[hydrochloric acid]], found in people's stomachs, can dissociate into a chloride anion and a free proton, and the property of the free proton is how it can digest food by corroding it.  Although rare on Earth, the H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> cation is one of the most common ions in the universe.  === Isotopes === :''Main article: [[isotopes of hydrogen]]'' Hydrogen has 7 known isotopes, two of which are stable (<sup>1</sup>H and <sup>2</sup>H), which are commonly referred to protium and deuterium. The isotope <sup>3</sup>H is known as [[tritium]] and has a half life of 12.33 years, and is produced in small amounts by [[cosmic ray]]s. The remaining 4 isotopes have half lives on the scale of yoctoseconds.  == Hydrogen in nature == In its pure form on Earth, hydrogen is usually a [[gas]]. Hydrogen is also one of the parts that make up a [[water]] molecule. Hydrogen is important because it is the [[fuel]] that powers the [[Sun]] and other stars. Hydrogen makes up about 74% of the entire [[universe]].<ref name="ut">{{cite web|last=Cain|first=Fraser, ''Universe Today''|title=When was the first light in the universe?|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-11-universe.html|publisher=Phys.org|accessdate=29 November 2016|date=November 7, 2016}}</ref> Hydrogen's symbol on the [[Periodic Table]] of Elements is H.  Pure hydrogen is normally made of two hydrogen [[atoms]] connected together. Scientists call these [[diatomic]] [[molecules]]. Hydrogen will have a [[chemical reaction]] when mixed with most other elements. It has no [[color]] or [[Odor|smell]].  Pure hydrogen is very uncommon in the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]], because nearly all primordial hydrogen would have escaped into space due to its weight. In nature, it is usually in [[water]].  Hydrogen is also in all living things, as a part of the [[organic compounds]] that living things are made of.  In addition, hydrogen atoms can combine with [[carbon]] atoms to form [[hydrocarbons]].  [[Petroleum]] and other [[fossil fuels]] are made of these [[hydrocarbons]] and commonly used to create energy for human use.  Some other facts about hydrogen: * It is a gas at [[room temperature]] * It acts like a [[metal]] when it is solid. * It is the lightest element in the [[Universe]]. * It is the most common element in the Universe.<ref name="EIA">[http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energyfacts/sources/IntermediateHydrogen.html EIA.doe.gov - What is Hydrogen?]</ref> * It burns or [[explosion|explodes]] when it touches a [[fire|flame]]. * glows [[purple]] when it is in [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] [[state of matter|state]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chemrec.se/Syngas_the_link_from_feedstock_to_synthetic_product.aspx|title=The magic of syngas|last=|first=|year=2012|work=chemrec.se|accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref>  == History of Hydrogen == Hydrogen was first separated in 1671 by [[Robert Boyle]]. [[Henry Cavendish]] in 1776 identified it as a distinct element and discovered that burning it made water.  [[Antoine Lavoisier]] gave Hydrogen its name, from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for [[water]], ' (pronounced /HEEW-dor/) and gennen meaning to "generate" as it forms water in a [[chemical reaction]] with oxygen.  == Uses of Hydrogen == The main uses are in the [[petroleum]] industry and in making [[ammonia]] by the [[Haber process]]. Some is used elsewhere in the [[chemical]] industry. A little of it is used as [[fuel]], for example in [[rocket]]s for [[spacecraft]]. Most of the hydrogen that people use comes from a [[chemical reaction]] between [[natural gas]] and [[steam]].  === Nuclear fusion ===  [[Nuclear fusion]] is a very powerful source of [[energy]]. It relies on forcing [[atom]]s together to make [[helium]] and energy, exactly as happens in a [[star]] like the [[Sun]], or in a [[hydrogen bomb]]. This needs a large amount of energy to get started, and is not easy to do yet. A big advantage over [[nuclear fission]], which is used in today's [[nuclear power]] stations, is that it makes less nuclear waste and does not use a toxic and rare [[fuel]] like [[uranium]].  More than 600 million tons of hydrogen undergo fusion every second on the Sun.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iter.org/sci/whatisfusion |title=What is Fusion? |first= |last= |work=iter.org |year=2012  |accessdate=7 March 2012|publisher=ITER Organization}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/qa_sun.html|title=NASA's Cosmicopia|publisher=NASA|accessdate=28 February 2013|archive-date=6 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106095009/http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/qa_sun.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>  === Using hydrogen === Hydrogen is mostly used in the petroleum industry, to change heavy petroleum fractions into lighter, more useful ones. It is also used to make [[ammonia]]. Smaller amounts are burned as fuel. Most hydrogen is made by a reaction between [[natural gas]] and [[steam]].  The [[electrolysis of water]] breaks water into hydrogen and oxygen, using electricity. Burning hydrogen combines with oxygen molecules to make [[steam]] (pure water vapor). A [[fuel cell]] combines hydrogen with an oxygen [[molecule]], releasing an electron as electricity. For these reasons, many people believe hydrogen power will eventually replace other [[synthetic fuel]]s.  Hydrogen can also be burned to make heat for [[steam turbine]]s or [[internal combustion engine]]s. Like other synthetic fuels, hydrogen can be created from natural fuels such as [[coal]] or natural gas, or from electricity, and therefore represents a valuable addition to the [[power grid]]; in the same role as [[natural gas]]. Such a grid and infrastructure with [[:en:Fuel cell vehicle|fuel cell vehicles]] is now planned by a number of countries including Japan, Korea and many European countries. This allows these countries to buy less [[petroleum]], which is an economic advantage. The other advantage is that used in a fuel cell or burned in a combustion engine as in a [[hydrogen car]], the motor does not make pollution. Only water, and a small amount of  [[nitrogen oxide]]s, forms.  == References == {{reflist}}  == Other websites == * [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Hydrogen Hydrogen] -Citizendium  {{Periodic Table}} {{authority control}} [[Category:Chemical elements| ]] [[Category:Nonmetals]] [[Category:Hydrogen| ]]</text>
