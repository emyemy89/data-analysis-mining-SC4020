It has a [[population]] of 104,000 people. People believe that Colchester is the oldest [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] town in England.  == History ==  Before Roman times, Colchester was ''Camulodunon''. This is a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] name that came from [[Camulos]]. Camulos was the [[Celt]]ic [[deity|god]] of [[war]]. The Romans called Colchester ''Camulodunum'' (written "CAMVLODVNVM") and made it the capital of [[Roman Britain]]. Colchester was attacked and burnt by [[Boudicca]] in [[61]] AD.  The Romans moved their capital of Britannia to Londinium (now London), but Camulodunum remained an important city until the fifth century, when the Saxons conquered the region.

The church at the [[Benedictine]] [[abbey]] of [[John the Baptist|Saint John the Baptist]] was destroyed in [[1539]].  This action was part of the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] by King [[Henry VIII]].  Only a gate remains, that people still go to visit.  King [[Cunobelinus]] (or "Cunobelin") was from Colchester.  == Twin cities == Colchester is [[sister city|twinned]] with the following cities: * {{flagicon|Italy}} [[Imola]], [[Italy]] * {{flagicon|Germany}} [[Wetzlar]], [[Germany]] * {{flagicon|France}} [[Avignon]], [[France]]   ==Notes== <references/>  ==Bibliography== * B D'Ambrosio.
