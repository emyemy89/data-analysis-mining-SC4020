<title>LOL</title><text>{{about|the slang term|an online game also known as "LOL"|League of Legends}} {{Redirect|LMFAO|the music group|LMFAO (group)}} [[File:Candylol.jpg|thumb|LOL on [[candy]]]] '''LOL''', or '''lol''', is an [[internet slang]] term that means "[[laugh]](ing) out loud". It is commonly mistaken for "lots of [[love]]." LOL is often used in [[wikt:message|messages]] meaning "That is really [[Humour|funny]]."    It also means [[mute]] in [[Persian language|Persian]] and is a native [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word (not an [[acronym]]) which means "fun" ("[[wikt:lollig|lollig]]" means "funny"). In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], lol means [[nonsense]] - e.g., if a person wanted to say "utter nonsense" in Welsh, they would say "rwtsh lol".<ref name="cscs">{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/fun/welsh/LexiconWE.html|title=Welsh-English Lexicon|publisher=Cardiff School of Computer Science|accessdate=2008-07-15|archive-date=2008-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217073455/http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/fun/welsh/LexiconWE.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> LOL is usually used on the internet or when text messaging.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=used%20in%20chat%20and%20text%20messaging |title=Urban Dictionary: used in chat and text messaging |first= |last= |work=urbandictionary.com |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref>  ==Words similar to "LOL"== * '''lolz''',''' lulz''',''' lul, lawls, '''or''' lawl/lawlzies''': Sometimes used instead of '''LOL''', but can have other meanings. * '''LOOOOOL''': For more [[wikt:emphasis|emphasis]].
