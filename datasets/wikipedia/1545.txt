<title>Turing test</title><text>[[File:Turing Test version 3.png|thumb|right|Person A (actually a computer) and Person B both say that they are human. Person C tries to find out whether Person A or Person B is the computer or the human.]]  The '''Turing test''' is a test to see if a [[computer]] can interact with a [[person]]. The human should not be able to realise it is interacting with a computer.   [[Alan Turing]] thought that if a [[human]] could not tell the difference between another human and the computer, then the computer had shown intelligent behaviour.<ref>Harnad, Stevan 2008.

The person can ask anything with the telegraph. If the person cannot tell which of the two is the machine more than 50% of the time, then the machine is said to be ''intelligent''.  Later on, people narrowed down the test. A human is unlikely to know everything. Therefore, both the [[human]] and the machine would be specialists in some field of [[knowledge]]. So would the person asking.  == Media == The comic strip [[Dilbert]] makes several mentions to the PHB (Pointy Haired Boss) failing the Turing test.  == References == {{reflist}}  == Related pages == *[[AlphaGo]]  ==Other websites== *{{Scientific American Frontiers|2|5|Machines Who Think}}   [[Category:Artificial intelligence]]</text>
