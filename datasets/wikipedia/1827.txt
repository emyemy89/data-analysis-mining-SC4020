In the past, people called it '''consumption'''.  TB is caused by several types of [[Mycobacterium|mycobacteria]], usually ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.<ref name="Robbins"/> The disease usually attacks the [[lung]]s, but it can also affect other parts of the body.  == How it spreads == The bacteria can travel through the air and spread from one person to the next. This happens when infected people [[cough]], [[sneeze]], or spit.<ref name="AP">{{cite journal|author = Konstantinos A|year = 2010|title = Testing for tuberculosis|journal = Australian Prescriber|volume = 33|issue = 1|pages = 1218|url = http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/1/12/18/}}</ref>  Of every 100 people with TB, between five and ten people show [[symptom]]s.<ref name="Pet2005">{{cite book|last = Peter G.

Tuberculosis kills more than half of the people who are infected if they do not get treatment.  ==Detection and treatment== [[File:TB Culture.jpg|thumb|A close up of a culture of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''. The patches that look like foam are the typical growth pattern of these bacteria|78x78px]]  [[Diagnosis]] of active TB relies on [[radiology]]. Doctors often look at an [[X-ray]] of the [[chest]]. In addition, they check body [[fluid]]s. These fluids have [[microbe]]s in them, which are grown in [[cell culture]]s. The cell cultures are then analysed to see if the person is infected with TB.  If the patient has TB, but does not show symptoms, the disease is 'latent'. Doctors use a [[skin]] test, called the [[Mantoux test]], to detect latent TB. They often do [[blood]] tests too.  There is a [[vaccine]] against some forms of tuberculosis. It is called [[bacillus Calmette-Gurin|bacillus Calmette&ndash;Gurin]] vaccine.  TB used to be easily treated and cured with [[antibiotics]]. However, the bacterium is now highly resistant to most antibiotics. This resistance makes treatment difficult. Many different kinds of antibiotics need to be given over a long period of time. There is a form of tuberculosis that is resistant to ''all'' [[drug]]s.  == Symptoms == Tuberculosis can have many symptoms.  The most common include: * A cough that does not go away, especially if the person is coughing up blood (this is called hemoptysis) * Chest pain * Not having any [[appetite]] * Weakness * Weight loss * Chills * Very pale skin * Listless eyes  * [[Fever]] * [[Sweat]]ing a lot at night * [[Dyspnea|Difficulty breathing]] * [[Fatigue|Feel]] * *her people who have TB.  For example, TB can spread easily in [[homeless shelter]]s, [[prison]]s, and [[Immigration|immigrant]] communities. ==How common is TB?== [[File:Tuberculosis-prevalence-WHO-2009.svg|thumb|alt=World map with [[sub-Saharan Africa]] in various shades of yellow, marking prevalences above 300 per 100,000 people, and with the U.S., Canada, Australia, and northern Europe in shades of deep blue, marking prevalence around 10 per 100,000 people.
