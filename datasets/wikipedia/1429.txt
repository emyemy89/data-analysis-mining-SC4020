<title>Variegated leaf</title><text>[[Image:Ficus aspera 2.jpg|thumb|220px|Variegated leaves of the ficus aspera]]  A '''variegated leaf''' is a type of leaf.  == Uses == A variegated leaf is useful in conducting experiments to show that [[chlorophyll]] is needed for photosynthesis to happen. They are also popular in [[horticulture]].  === Experiments === The easiest of these experiments is to stain the places where [[starch]] is produced (starch is a more compact form of [[glucose]]).  Place the leaves in boiling water for six minutes to soften the cells, and then in [[ethanol]] (alcohol). When the leaves are drained of colour, spread them out on a flat surface. Soak the leaves in [[iodine]] and the green parts will turn blue/black and the non green parts will stay the yellowish brown colour of iodine liquid. The green parts contain starch, which makes [[iodine]] turn blue/black. The blue/black stain is what shows starch is present. You could take "before & after" photos to prove the black areas were green at the start.  [[Category:Plant anatomy]] [[Category:Experiments]]</text>
