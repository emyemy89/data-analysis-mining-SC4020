<title>Wikipedia:About</title><text>{{hatnote|'''Note''': This page describes what Wikipedia and the Simple English Wikipedia is about for new users, and is not a Wikipedia article. There are article pages about [[Wikipedia]] and the [[Simple English Wikipedia]].}} {{shortcut|WP:ABOUT|WP:WIKIPEDIA|WP:HELLO|WP:SEW|WP:SEWP|WP:SIMPLE}} The '''[[Simple English Wikipedia|Simple English Wikipedia]]''' is a [[open content|free]] [[encyclopedia]] for people who are learning English. The Simple English Wikipedia's articles can be used to help with [[school]] [[homework]] or just for the fun of learning about new [[idea]]s. Non-English Wikipedias can also [[translate]] from the articles here.  Wikipedia started on [[January 15]], [[2001]] and it has over 35,000,000 articles in many languages, including {{NUMBEROFARTICLES}} in Simple English. Most of these articles are in languages other than English. Every day hundreds of people from around the world make hundreds of changes and create lots of new articles.  ''Note:'' Wikipedia has pages that some people might think are bad, vulgar or mean. Read [[:en:Wikipedia:Content disclaimer|the Wikipedia content disclaimer]] for more information.  ==What is the Simple English Wikipedia?==  Articles in the Simple English Wikipedia use fewer words and grammar that is easier to understand than the [[:en:|ordinary English Wikipedia]]. The Simple English Wikipedia is also for people with different needs, such as [[child]]ren, [[student]]s and [[adult]]s with [[learning disability|learning difficulties]], and people who are trying to learn English. Other people may use the Simple English Wikipedia because simple language helps them to understand unfamiliar topics or [[complex]] ideas.  When the Simple English Wikipedia began, the [[:en:|ordinary English Wikipedia]] already had 150,000 articles, and seven other Wikipedias in other [[language]]s had over 15,000 articles. Since the other Wikipedias already have so many articles, most Simple English articles take articles from other Wikipedias and make them simple; they are usually not new articles.  This makes Simple English articles a good way to understand difficult articles from the ordinary English Wikipedia. If someone cannot understand an idea in complex English, they can read the Simple English article. For this reason, people writing Simple English articles should put in "[[meta:Help:Interwiki linking|interwiki links]]" to and from the other Wikipedias. Also, it is good to always look at '''all''' versions in all languages, to get new ideas.  "[[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not]]" has a good list of things which we are ''not'' doing. These things are a little different from the things the ordinary English Wikipedia does not do. For example, in the Simple English version it is more important to explain [[slang]], [[idiom]]s, and [[jargon]]. The Simple English Wikipedia also has some articles that are also in the [[Wiktionary]].  ==Changing pages in the Simple English Wikipedia== Wikipedia is a [[wiki]], a kind of [[web site]] written by many people together. This means anyone can change any page by clicking on the "change this page" link. You can do this on any page that is not [[Wikipedia:Protection policy|protected]]. You can see if the page is protected because it will say "View source" instead of "Change".  Anyone can write in the Simple English Wikipedia. [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Simple English writers]] are very mixed, more so than at English Wikipedia, or at other Wikipedias. It is important to respect the different types of people who are writing articles in the Simple English Wikipedia, and to be friendly with people who have trouble speaking English. Remember that Wikipedia is a service which many communities use.  If you want to write articles for the Simple English Wikipedia, read [[Wikipedia:How to write Simple English articles]]. See [[Wikipedia]] for a simple English introduction to the project in all languages, and [[Wikipedia:Useful]] for a list of pages that can help you more. You can ask questions at [[Wikipedia:Simple talk]].  Any pages that you write and any changes that you make are yours. A license called the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] guarantees that people will always be able to use and make copies of all of Wikipedia including your pages and changes.

We suggest that articles should use only the 1,000 most common and basic words in English. They should also use only simple grammar and shorter sentences. Writers can also use a special system, for example, [[Basic English]]. Of course, people can write original articles; these could be put in both this and the English Wikipedia (with a normal level of English). Usually, only about 2,000 words are enough to write a normal article.   Since some articles need more than the most common words, some complex articles use more words. But even very basic concepts ([[zero]], [[one]], [[two]]) are too difficult to explain with a small number of words.  For detailed writing about [[science]], [[politics]], or [[religion]], articles sometimes need more words, but the English must be simple. Sometimes, an article needs words not included in the [[Wikipedia:Basic English combined wordlist|Basic English combined wordlist]], but it explains all the difficult words. Articles may also need some complex words because of the article names in the [[:en:|ordinary English Wikipedia]], and to use normal words would make the article too simple. Articles on scientific topics might also need complex words.  There are no rules about [[vocabulary]], [[grammatical tense|tense]] or [[suffix]]es. Some articles use only [[Basic English]] (850 words), but this wiki has no strong rules about which words can be used, as [[E Prime]] does. If a word is not simple or not used often here, it should be explained on a new page.  ==Proposals to close the Simple English Wikipedia== There have been proposals to close the Simple English Wikipedia. Proposals in [[:meta:Proposals for closing projects/Closure of Simple English Wikipedia|October 2007]] and in [[:meta:Proposals for closing projects/Closure of Simple English Wikipedia (2)|October 2008]] lost. Another proposal was made in [[:meta:Proposals for closing projects/Closure of Simple English Wikipedia (3)|June 2018]]. That proposal resulted in the Simple English Wikipedia remaining online.  ==Be part of Wikipedia== *[[:en:Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome, newcomers!]], a place to start for new people. *[[Wikipedia:rules|Rules]] for how to behave on Wikipedia. *[[Help:Contents|How to edit pages]] and [[Wikipedia:Useful|do other things]] on Wikipedia.  ==Getting in touch== *[[Wikipedia:Contact us|Contact us]] *[[Wikipedia:Simple talk|Simple talk]], a place to ask questions *[[Wikipedia:mailing lists|Wikipedia mailing lists]] *[[Wikipedia:Bug reports|Bug reports and feature requests]] *[[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedians]], a list of people who help with Wikipedia *[[meta:|Meta Wiki]], more about Wikipedia and other projects like it  ==Other wiki projects== *[http://www.wiktionary.org/ Wiktionary] has a [[dictionary]] and [[thesaurus]] in lots of languages.
