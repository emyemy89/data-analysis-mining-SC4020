It is made to be eaten at [[Christmas]]. It can also be called a '''fruitcake'''.  A common favorite of many is the [[traditional]] [[Scotland|Scottish]] Christmas cake, the "Whisky Dundee." It was named this because the cake came from Dundee and is made with Scotch [[whisky]]. It is a [[light]] and crumbly cake, and light on [[fruit]] and [[Candy|candied]] peelonly currants, [[raisin]]s, [[sultanas]] and [[cherry|cherries]]. This Christmas cake is mostly good for people who do not like very sweet and moist cakes. As with all fruitcakes, [[almond]]s (or other [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s) can be removed by people who do not like them or those with bad nut [[allergies]].  At the other end of the Christmas cake tradition, the [[apple]] [[cream]] Christmas cake is a sweet mix of sliced apples, raisins and other fruit, with [[egg (food)|egg]]s, [[cream cheese]], and heavy whipping cream.  In the middle of the other two listed above is the mincemeat Christmas cake. It is simply any traditional or [[vegetarian]] mincemeat mixed with [[flour]], eggs, and other pastry ingredients, to transform it into a [[cake]] batter; or it can also be steamed as a [[Christmas pudding]].  A premade fruitcake mix can be bought at a grocery store.  {{cookbook|Christmas Cake}} {{Commonscat|Christmas cakes|Christmas Cake}}   {{food-stub}}  [[Category:Cakes]] [[Category:Christmas]]</text>
