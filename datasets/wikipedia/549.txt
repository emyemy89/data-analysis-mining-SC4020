Windows is used by almost 90% of desktop and [[laptop]] computers.  == History == The first version of Windows, Windows 1.0, came out on November 20, 1985. The newest version, [[Windows 10]], came out July 29, 2015. Most new [[personal computer]]s come with Windows 10. However, some older or cheaper personal computers may come with [[Windows 8.1]] or [[Windows 7]].  Windows makes it easier to run [[Computer software|programs]] (applications) than [[MS-DOS]] did. [[DOS]], required [[Typing|typed]] [[Command Line Interface|commands]] to make the computer do something. DOS required correct [[syntax]] of each command. Making mistakes caused the computer to usually give an [[error]] message and do nothing.  == Design == Users control their Windows computer by its [[Graphical user interfaces and consoles|graphical user interface]] (or GUI for short). It only needs a [[Keyboard (computer)|keyboard]] ''or'' a [[Computer mouse|mouse]] to work. In later versions, a touch screen works as well. However, using both a keyboard and a mouse makes many tasks easier. By clicking a few [[Button (control)|buttons]] on the screen, Windows helps keep your files safe, and easier to change and move. Versions of Windows after 2005 make it even easier for some [[Accessibility|users with disabilities]] because these versions have touch screens. For use of a touch screen, some [[Mobile device|mobile devices]] come with Windows. [[Tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s such as [[Microsoft Surface]] and [[Microsoft Lumia]] use Windows.  == Programs == The following programs are included with Windows:  * [[WordPad]]  to write simple documents, typically using words/text. * Windows Photo Viewer  to look at pictures. * [[Microsoft Paint]]  to make simple drawings or change pictures. * [[Microsoft Edge]] web browser  to use the [[Internet]] to look at [[World Wide Web|web]] pages and [[download]] files. * Windows DVD Player to watch videos. * Windows Groove to play and listen to music  Windows has several kinds of applications/programs available. Popular applications include [[Video games|games]], [[word processor]]s (to write words) or additional programs like [[Adobe Flash Player]] (to watch some videos and play many games on internet sites). Adding new applications to Windows is called "installing". Applications can be bought/purchased on a CD or [[DVD]]. Applications can also be downloaded from the Internet. Some internet applications can be downloaded for free, and others can [[Online shopping|be bought using the internet]].  == Versions == {| class="wikitable sortable mw-collapsible" style="font-size: 90%; text-align: left; " |- ! abbr="release" | Release date ! abbr="name"    | Product name !

Some users complain that Windows made their computers slower when they changed from DOS. Many people also complain about problems that make their computer less safe to use, even though Microsoft tries to fix these problems. Many [[computer virus]]es are created to infect computers running Windows since it is such a popular operating system. Windows was the most popular operating system until recently (today [[mobile operating system]]s such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]] are more popular).  == References == {{reflist}}  == Other websites == * [http://www.microsoft.com/windows The Microsoft Windows website] * [https://blogs.windows.com/ The Windows Team Blog]  Official blog of the Windows Team at Microsoft  {{Microsoft Windows operating systems}} {{Operating systems}}  [[Category:Microsoft operating systems]]</text>
