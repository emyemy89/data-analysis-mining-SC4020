It is separated from Asia by the [[Ural Mountains]] in [[Russia]] and the [[Bosporus]] [[strait]] in [[Turkey]].  Europe is bordered by water on three sides. On the west is the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. To the north is the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The [[Mediterranean Sea]] separates [[Southeastern Europe]] from [[Africa]]. On the eastern border of Europe are the [[Ural River]] and [[Ural Mountains]].  There are at least 43 countries in Europe (the European identities of 5 transcontinental countries:Cyprus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkey are disputed). Most of these countries are members of the [[European Union]].  Europe covers about 10,180,000 [[square kilometre|square kilometers]] (3,930,000 [[square mile|square miles]]). This is 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of its land area).  As of 2017, about 510 million people lived in Europe.<ref>"[https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/ World Populations Prospects, the 2015 RevisionS]". United Nations - Department of Economic and Social Affairs - Population Division.</ref>  Europe makes 44% of the world's wine.  Europe contains the world's second most-active volcano, which is [[Mount Etna]] that is currently the most-active volcano in the continent.  Europe is a major [[Tourism|tourist]] attraction. People come from all over the world to see its many [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Sites]] and other attractions.  == Origin of name == Europe is named after a princess in [[Greek mythology]] called "Europa." The [[Mythology|myth]] says that [[Zeus]] [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] Europa and took her to [[Crete]], where she became the mother of King [[Minos]] (from whom Europes first civilization gets its name, the [[Minoa|Minoans]]).  The name "Europa" was later used to describe [[Greece]]. Then, as the rest of modern-day Europe started to have cities and [[empire|empires]], the entire area West of the [[Ural Mountains]] came to be called "Europa".  == History == {{Main|History of Europe}}  The history of Europe is long and has many turns. Many great countries originated from Europe. [[Greek mythology]] and the beginning of [[western civilization]] came from European nations.  Some of the major periods in European history have been: * [[Ancient Greece]] ([[Minoan civilization|Minoan]], [[Mycenaean]], [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]], [[Classical Greece|Classical]], [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]]): c.2000 BC to 146 BC * [[Ancient Rome]] ([[Roman kingdom]], [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire]]): 753BC-476 * [[Middle Ages]] ([[Early Middle Ages|Early]], [[High Middle Ages|High]], [[Late middle ages|Late]]): 476 to 1492 * [[Early modern period|Early Modern Era]] ([[Renaissance]], [[Reformation]], [[Age of Discovery]], [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]): 1492-1789 * [[19th Century]], [[20th Century]] and [[21st Century]] ([[French Revolution]], [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[Industrial Revolution]], [[Colonialism]], [[World War 1]], [[World War 2]], [[Cold War]]) 1789-present  == Regions and countries == Andreas M. Kaplan describes modern Europe as a continent where many different [[culture]]s live closely together, "embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006|title=Andreas M. Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools, European Management Journal, 2014}}</ref>  There are several major regions of Europe: * [[Eastern Europe]] * [[Central Europe]] * [[Western Europe]] * [[Northern Europe]] * [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]] Within these regions, there are up to 48 [[Sovereign state|independent European countries]] (with the identities of 5 transcontinental countries being disputed). The largest is the [[Russian Federation]], which covers 39% of Europe.  The European city with the largest [[population]] is [[Istanbul]]. The country with the largest population is the Russian Federation. About 15% of Europeans live in Russia.  Two European countries, the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], are on [[island]]s called the [[British Isles]].  == Climate == Most of Europe lies in [[Temperate zone|temperateclimate zones]].  However, there are many different [[climate]]s throughout Europe. For example, during the winter, it may be snowing and -30 degrees [[Celsius]] for 45 months in [[Finland]]. Yet it may be much warmer, with no snow at all except on high mountains, in [[Spain]].  == European Union == {{Main|European Union}}  The [[European Union]] is a [[confederation]]of 27 European countries. These countries agree to follow common laws so that their citizens can move and trade in EU countries almost the same as they do in their own. Nineteen of these countries also share the same type of[[money]]: the[[euro]].  == List of Countries == * {{flag|Albania}} * {{flag|Andorra}} * {{flag|Austria}} (EU) * {{flag|Belarus}} * {{flag|Belgium}} (EU) * {{flag|Bosnia and Herzegovina}} * {{flag|Bulgaria}} (EU) * {{flag|Croatia}} (EU) * {{flag|Czech Republic}} (EU) * {{flag|Cyprus}} (EU) Geologically in Europe and Asia * {{flag|Denmark}} (EU) * {{flag|Estonia}} (EU) * {{flag|Finland}} (EU) * {{flag|France}} (EU) * {{flag|Georgia}} Geologically in Europe and Asia * {{flag|Germany}} (EU) * {{flag|Greece}} (EU) * {{flag|Hungary}} (EU) * {{flag|Iceland}} Geologically in Europe and North America * {{flag|Ireland}} (EU) * {{flag|Italy}} (EU) * {{flag|Kazakhstan}} Geologically in Europe and Asia * {{flag|Latvia}} (EU) * {{flag|Liechtenstein}} * {{flag|Lithuania}} (EU) * {{flag|Luxembourg}} (EU) * {{flag|Macedonia}} (EU) * {{flag|Malta}} (EU) * {{flag|Moldova}} * {{flag|Monaco}} * {{flag|Montenegro}}  * {{flag|Netherlands}} (EU) * {{flag|Norway}} * {{flag|Poland}} (EU) * {{flag|Portugal}} (EU) * {{flag|North Macedonia}}  * {{flag|Romania}} (EU) * {{flag|Russia}} Geologically in Europe and Asia * {{flag|San Marino}} * {{flag|Serbia}}  * {{flag|Slovakia}} (EU) * {{flag|Slovenia}} (EU) * {{flag|Spain}} (EU) * {{flag|Sweden}} (EU) * {{flag|Switzerland}} * {{flag|Turkey}} Geologically in Europe and Asia * {{flag|Ukraine}} * {{flag|United Kingdom}} * {{flag|Vatican City}}  ==References== {{commonscat}} {{reflist}}  {{Continent}} {{Europe}} {{European Union}}  [[Category:Europe| ]]</text>
