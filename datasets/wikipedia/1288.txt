This is called ''physical exercise''.  ==Basic modes of physical exercises== {{main|Physical fitness}} People do physical exercises as a part of their [[healthy lifestyle]] to get stronger and healthier or stay strong and [[healthy]] or to improve their [[body image]].  There are three basic modes of physical exercises:  * [[Flexibility training|Flexibility exercises]] help the human body in general or its part in particular to be able to reach farther and bend better.   * [[Aerobics|Aerobic]] exercises help the body work hard for a long time.   * [[Anaerobic]] exercises, like lifting weights, make the arms and legs stronger.  Exercises can be an important part of physical [[therapy]], weight loss, or [[sport]]s performance.  Exercise can be [[wikt:fun|fun]], but it is important for the exerciser to do what he likes and [[food|eat]] enough [[calorie]]s , so when he exercises he is building up [[muscle]]s, not just breaking them down for fuel. [[Carbohydrate]]s are muscle-sparing; and if one does not get enough calories overall, there is the risk of burning muscles up with the [[fat]] to make up the deficit.  ==Exercise benefits== Benefits of exercise for all ages have been known since antiquity. [[Marcus Cicero]], around 65 BC, stated: It is exercise alone that supports the spirits, and keeps the mind in vigor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inspirational-quotes-and-quotations.com/quotes-about-exercise.html |title=Quotes About Exercise Top 10 List. }}</ref>  Regular exercise has been shown to help high [[blood pressure]], [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], [[diabetes]], and [[depression (illness)|depression]], among others.
