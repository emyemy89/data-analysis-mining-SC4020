Argentina is the second-largest [[country]] in [[South America]] and the eighth-largest country in the world.  [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the most spoken language, and the official language, but many other languages are spoken. There are minorities speaking [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Quechua]] and even [[Welsh language|Welsh]] in [[Patagonia]].  In eastern Argentina is [[Buenos Aires]], the [[Capital city|capital]] of Argentina, it is also one of the largest cities in the world. In order by number of people, the largest [[city|cities]] in Argentina are [[Buenos Aires]], [[Crdoba, Argentina|Crdoba]], [[Rosario]], [[Mendoza]], [[La Plata]], [[Tucumn]], [[Mar del Plata]],  [[Salta]], [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], and [[Baha Blanca]].  Argentina is between the [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] in the west and the southern [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east and south. It is bordered by [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]] in the north, [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]] in the northeast, and [[Chile]] in the west and south. It also claims the [[Falkland Islands]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Islas Malvinas'') and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].  Most citizens of the Argentine Republic are descendants of immigrants from Europe.  They are united by [[citizenship]] and not necessarily by [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]]. Most Argentinians embrace both their ethnic origins and Argentinian nationality.  == History == The name '''Argentina''' comes from the [[Latin]] ''argentum'' ([[silver]]) as the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s believed the area had [[silver]]. In the Americas (South and North), Canada, US, Brazil and Argentina are the largest countries (in that order).  The oldest signs of people in Argentina are in the [[Patagonia]] (Piedra Museo, Santa Cruz), and are more than 13,000 years old. In 1480 the [[Inca Empire]] conquered northwestern Argentina, making it part of the empire. In the northeastern area, the [[Guaran]] developed a culture based on [[yuca]] and [[sweet potato]] however typical dishes all around Argentina are pasta, red wines (Italian influence) and beef.  Other languages spoken are Italian, English and German. Lunfardo is Argentinean slang and is a mix of Spanish and Italian. Argentinians are said to speak Spanish with an Italian accent.  Argentina declared independent from Spain in 1816, and achieved it in a War led by [[Jos de San Martn]] in 1818. Many immigrants from Europe came to the country. By the 1920s it was the 7th wealthiest country in the world, but it began a decline after this. In the 1940s, following the "infamous decade" where the country's politics were not stable, [[Juan Peron]] came to power. Peron was one of the most important people in the country's history and many politicians today call themselves Peronist. Peron was forced out of power in 1955. After spending years in exile he returned to power in the 1970s.  In 1976, the country was falling into chaos, and the military took power. This was not the first time the military had done this. Leading the new government was [[Jorge Rafael Videla]]. Videla was one of history's most brutal dictators. Thousands of people disappeared or were killed during his time as president. Videla retired in 1980.  One of his successors was another general turned dictator, [[Leopoldo Galtieri]]. By the time Galtieri was in office in 1981 the dictatorship became unpopular. To stir up support, Galtieri ordered an invasion of the [[Falkland Islands]], starting the [[Falklands War]].  Argentina lost the war, and soon the country fell into chaos again. Galtieri was removed from power and eventually [[democracy]] was restored. Galtieri and Videla would be charged with "crimes against humanity" because of the mass murder and other crimes that they ordered as president.  In the early 21st century Argentina is one of the most important countries in [[Latin America]], though it still has many problems. It has a large economy and is influential in the "southern cone" of South America and a member of the [[G20 developing nations]].  == Politics == Argentina is a [[federal republic]]. The people of Argentina vote for a [[President]] to rule them and [[Senator]]s and [[Deputy|Deputies]] to speak for them and make laws for them. The President is Alberto Fernndez since December 2019.  == Administrative divisions == [[File:ViedoCafayate.jpg|thumb|Salta]] Argentina is divided into 23 [[province]]s (''provincias''; singular: ''provincia''), and 1 city (commonly known as ''capital federal''): {| | # [[Buenos Aires|Ciudad Autnoma de Buenos Aires]]<sup>*</sup> # [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires (Province)]] # [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]] # [[Chaco Province|Chaco]] # [[Chubut Province|Chubut]] # [[Crdoba Province, Argentina|Crdoba]] # [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]] # [[Entre Ros Province|Entre Ros]] # [[Formosa Province|Formosa]] # [[Jujuy Province|Jujuy]] # [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]] # [[La Rioja Province (Argentina)|La Rioja]] | <ol start=13> <li> [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]] </li> <li> [[Misiones Province|Misiones]] </li> <li> [[Neuqun Province|Neuqun]] </li> <li> [[Ro Negro Province|Ro Negro]] </li> <li> [[Salta Province|Salta]] </li> <li> [[San Juan Province (Argentina)|San Juan]] </li> <li> [[San Luis Province|San Luis]] </li> <li> [[Santa Cruz Province (Argentina)|Santa Cruz]] </li> <li> [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] </li> <li> [[Santiago del Estero Province|Santiago del Estero]] </li> <li> [[Tierra del Fuego Province (Argentina)|Tierra del Fuego]] </li> <li> [[Tucumn Province|Tucumn]] </li> </ol> |}  == Geography == {{main|Geography of Argentina}} [[File:Argentina - Poltico.png|260px|thumb|left|alt=Map of Argentina|Map of Argentina]]  Argentina is almost 3,700&nbsp;km long from north to south, and 1,400&nbsp;km from east to west (maximum values). It can be divided into three parts: the [[Pampas]] in the central part of the country, [[Patagonia]] in the southern part down to [[Tierra del Fuego]]; and the [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] along the western border with [[Chile]], with the highest point in the province of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]. [[Cerro Aconcagua]], at 6,960 metres (22,834 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), is the [[Americas|Americas']] highest mountain.  The most important rivers include the [[Rio de la Plata|River Plate]], [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]], [[Bermejo River|Bermejo]], [[Colorado River (Argentina)|Colorado]], [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]] and the largest river, the [[Paran River|Paran]]. River Plate was incorrectly translated though, and should have been translated to English as River of (the) Silver. River Plate is also a famous Buenos Aires soccer team.  See [[List of cities in Argentina]] for the many places people live in Argentina.  == Other information == The majority of the Argentineans are descendants of Europeans mainly from [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[France]], other Europeans countries and [[Mestizo]] representing more than 90% of the total population of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html|title=The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}</ref> More than 300,000 [[Romani people|Roma gypsies]] live in Argentina. Since the 1990s, Romanian, Brazilian and Colombian gypsies arrived in Argentina.<ref>https://www.romarchive.eu/en/roma-civil-rights-movement/development-roma-civil-rights-movements-argentina/</ref>  [[Football in Argentina|Football]] or soccer is the most popular sport, although the national sport of the country is [[Pato]]. Argentina has a number of highly ranked [[Polo]] players. Field hockey (for women) rugby and golf are also favorites.  Argentina is a [[Christian]] country. Most of Argentina's people (80 percent) are [[Roman Catholic]]. Argentina also has the largest population of Jewish community after Israel and US. Middle Eastern immigrants who were Muslims converted to Catholicism, but there are still Muslims as well.  Medicine is socialized and so is education, making Argentina's literacy rate about 98%. State University is free as well.  ==Related pages== *[[Argentina at the Olympics]] *[[Argentina national football team]] *[[List of rivers of Argentina]]  == References == {{reflist}} <!-- section with alphabetical order --> <div class="references-small"> * [http://www.mapsofworld.com/argentina/index.html General information and maps] * [http://www.argentinatravelnet.com Geography and tourism] * [http://www.guiafe.com.ar/argentina-pictures Pictures from Argentina grouped by provincia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820011313/http://www.guiafe.com.ar/argentina-pictures/ |date=2006-08-20 }} </div>  == Other websites == {{sisterlinks|Argentina|voy=Argentina}} * [http://www.argentina.gov.ar Argentina.gov.ar] - Official national portal * [http://www.info.gov.ar Gobierno Electrnico] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903065827/http://www.info.gov.ar/ |date=2017-09-03 }} - Official government website * [http://www.presidencia.gov.ar Presidencia de la Nacin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113081118/http://www.presidencia.gov.ar/ |date=2010-11-13 }} - Official presidential website * [http://www.senado.gov.ar Honorable Senado de la Nacin] - Official senatorial website * [http://www.diputados.gov.ar Honorable Cmara de Diputados de la Nacin] - Official lower house website * [http://www.turismo.gov.ar Secretara de Turismo de la Nacin] - Official tourism board website  {{South America}} {{Authority control}}  [[Category:Argentina| ]] [[Category:Spanish-speaking countries]]</text>
