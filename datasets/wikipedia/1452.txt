Written in Chinese characters, it is in the Japanese language.]] [[File:Ja-ksb-botchan 1-1 1-2.ogg|thumb|Spoken Japanese]]  '''Japanese''' ('''''' "Nihon-go" in Japanese) is the [[official language]] of [[Japan]], in East [[Asia]]. Japanese belongs to the [[Japonic languages|Japonic language family]], which also includes the endangered [[Ryukyuan languages]]. One theory says Japanese and [[Korean language|Korean]] are related, but most linguists no longer think so. Other theories about the origin of Japanese are that it related to the [[Austronesian languages]], the [[Dravidian languages]], or the [https://simple.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/controversial controversial] [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] [[language family]]. Interestingly, a different term is used for Japanese as a course of study by citizens: it is <span>"kokugo" (), which means [[national language]]. Nonetheless, Japanese is still referred to as  by the Japanese.</span>  Japanese uses three separate writing systems: [[hiragana]], [[katakana]], and [[kanji]]. The first two are phonetic systems and so show the pronunciation of Japanese words, and kanji is the Japanese variation of [[Chinese character]]s and show the meaning of Japanese words. The three systems are used interchangeably, and all three systems can often be found in the same sentence. The three systems are each reserved for different purposes.  In [[English language|English]], the order of the words is very important. For example, the sentences "Is it?" and "It is." mean different things. In Japanese, differences are often made by adding or changing the ending of words (using the previous example, one would say them as  ''sou desu ka'' and  ''sou desu'', respectively). A Japanese word has a stem called a "body", and additional parts (called [[suffix]]es). Changing the suffix can change the meaning or the grammar of the word.  After [[World War II]], many English words entered the Japanese language. An example of one would be , aisukurmu, meaning [[ice cream]].  == Sounds == Japanese has five [[vowel]] sounds that can have two different lengths. They are ''a, i, u, e, o''. In IPA they are transliterated as /a/, /i/, //, /e/, /o/; and they are pronounced in English as ''ah, ee, oo, eh, oh''. Lengthening a vowel can change the meaning of the word: ''ojisan'' (, uncle) and ''ojiisan'' (, grandfather). Japanese has a sound that is like the [[English language|English]] ''l'', but it is also like the English ''r''. (That is why it can be difficult for many Japanese when to learn to make both sounds when they speak English.) Japanese has a sound that is not uncommon in English and is usually written ''Tsu'' (). This sound appears in "[[tsunami]]" (), the Japanese word for large ocean waves caused by [[earthquake]]s or [[extreme weather]].  == Grammar == When foreigners speak Japanese, it is important they know how formal they must be when they speak to people you may or may not know. In Japan, it could be considered quite impolite (rude) if you are not formal enough.  In Japanese, sentences use subject-object-verb (SOV) [[word order]], so the [[verb]] is at the end of the [[sentence]] and the [[wikt:subject|subject]] is at the beginning. Many sentences have no subject, and the listener can infer the subject based context and the form of a verb.  In Japanese, Japan is called ''Nihon'' (), and the language is called ''Nihongo'' () (-go means ''language''). Sometimes, the words ''Nippon'' and ''Nippongo'' are also used, but both words are now thought of as more [[nationalism|nationalist]], and ''Nihon'' is a more neutral word. The kanji of the word mean "[[sun]]-origin." Since Japan is at the eastern edge of Asia, to observers in [[China]], the sun rose from the direction of Japan. That is why Japan is called "The Land of Rising Sun."  Japanese is an [[agglutinative language]], especially in its verbs. Its words has a short "body," and prefixes or suffixes are easily added to change or to redefine the meaning.  Japanese words come from three main sources. The first is ''[[Yamato kotoba|wago]]'' (), which are native Japanese words and can also be called ''[[yamato kotoba]]'' (). The second is ''[[kango]]'' (), which are Chinese [[Loanword|loanwords]]. The third is ''[[gairaigo]]'' (), which are loanwords borrowed from languages other than Chinese (usually English since the [[World War II|Second World War]]).  == Writing System == Japanese has three main writing systems:   * [[Hiragana]] () * [[Katakana]] () * [[Kanji]] ()  Hiragana is a Syllabary, meaning each character represents a [[syllable]] or [[vowel]]. Hiragana is the standard, [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic]] writing system in Japanese and is used for grammatical words or particles to determine [[parts of speech]] (eg.  (wa, ka, o)); words that don't have Kanji characters (eg.  (kon'nichiwa - hello)); or for beginners to write Kanji. The symbols were originally adopted from Kanji characters and have changed overtime into their distinct, rounded shapes (e.g  ).<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-02-02|title=Origins of Hiragana () and Katakana ()|url=https://cotoacademy.com/hiragana-and-katakana-origins/|access-date=2021-01-27|website=Coto Japanese Academy|language=en-US}}</ref>  Katakana is also a Syllabary, with each Hiragana character having a character in Katakana (eg.  =   = ). Katakana is used for impact (similar to italics in English) as well as [[gairaigo]] words and direct [[Transliteration|transliterations]] from English (e.g  - Menyuu (Menu)). Katakana was originally made by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] Monks to teach Japanese people how to read Chinese.  Kanji is an adaptation of the Chinese [[Logogram|logographic]] writing system. Each symbol can represent a syllable (eg.  - dai) or a word (eg.  - oto (sound)). There are multiple pronunciations for each Kanji character, categorised into On'yomi (), where the pronunciation is based on the character and its components; and Kun'yomi (), where the pronunciation is based on the meaning of the character (eg.  (fire) can be pronounced as ka (on'yomi) or hi (kun'yomi)  == References == {{reflist}}  {{interwiki|code=ja}}  [[Category:Japanese language| ]]</text>
