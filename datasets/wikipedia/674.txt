It is often called '''[[Taiwan]]'''. The [[People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] is to the northwest; [[Japan]] is to the northeast; the [[Philippines]] is to the south. The Chinese Nationalists lost the [[Chinese Civil War]] to the Communists in 1949 and moved the government of the Republic of China from [[Nanjing]] to [[Taipei]]. It still claims the ownership of all of China including Mainland China.  == Territory == The territory the Republic of China (ROC) controls is known by most people as '''the island'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geofon.gfz-potsdam.de/eqinfo/list.php?page=2|title=GEOFON Program GFZ Potsdam :: Earthquake Bulletin|website=geofon.gfz-potsdam.de}}</ref> of '''[[Taiwan]]'''. Most places on Taiwan Island are called "[[Taiwan Province]]" by the government of the Republic of China for official business, except the two largest cities of [[Taipei]] and [[Kaohsiung]]. West of Taiwan Island, there are three small [[archipelago|groups of islands]] that also belong to ROC. They are: * The [[Pescadores]] (Penghu, ): They also are part of Taiwan Province. * [[Quemoy]] (Kinmen, ): A part of [[Fujian]] province, called Kinmen County(). * [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] (): the smallest county, called Lienchiang County(), also part of [[Fujian]] province * [[Senkaku Islands|Diaoyutai Islands]]:The Diaoyutai Islands (|Dioyti Liy|) are a group of islands where nobody lives that the Republic of China (ROC) claims it belong to them, but also claimed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Japan. In Japanese, the islands are known as the [[Senkaku Islands]] (, Senkaku Shot?). The islands are now under the control of Japan. * [[Dong-Sha Islands]]:The Pratas Islands or Dong-Sha Islands () consists of three islands in the northeastern South China Sea, 340&nbsp;km southeast of Hong Kong. * [[Taiping]] (Traditional Chinese: |Tipngdo|), also known as Itu Aba, is the largest of the Nansha Islands (Spratly Islands) in the South China Sea.  The ROC used to govern [[Mainland China]] too. Now Mainland China is governed by the Communist [[People's Republic of China]]; see [[#History|History]] and [[Political problems of China]]. However, ROC still declares Mainland China as its territory officially. The Republic of China also used to govern [[Mongolia]].  [[File:Republic of China (orthographic projection, historical).svg|right|250px|alt=Republic_of_China_(orthographic_projection,_historical).svg|thumb|This is the territory of the Republic of China between 1912 and 1949.]]  ==Administrative divisions== [[File:Taiwan ROC political divisions labeled.svg|260px]]  There are administrative divisions in different levels and types.  *Provinces ( shng )<br>(1st level): **[[Taiwan Province, Republic of China|Taiwan Province]] **[[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian Province]]  *Special municipalities ( zhxish )<br>(1st and 2nd level): **[[Kaohsiung City]] **[[New Taipei City]] **[[Taipei City]] **[[Taichung City]] **[[Tainan City]] **[[Taoyuan City]]  *Provincial cities ( sh )<br>(2nd level): **[[Keelung City]] **[[Hsinchu City]] **[[Chiayi City]]  *Counties ( xin )<br>(2nd level): **[[Changhua County]] **[[Chiayi County]] **[[Hsinchu County]] **[[Hualien County]] **[[Kinmen County]] **[[Lienchiang County]] **[[Miaoli County]] **[[Nantou County]] **[[Penghu County]] **[[Pingtung County]] **[[Taitung County]] **[[Yilan County]] **[[Yunlin County]]  157 Districts ( q ), 17 Country-controlled cities ( xinxish ), 41 Urban Townships ( zhn ), and 153 Rural Townships ( xing ) stand the 3rd level. Districts stand under either Special municipalities or Provincial cities; Country-controlled cities, Urban Townships, and Rural Townships stand under Counties.  Villages ( l  or  cn ) stand the 4th level, and Neighborhoods ( ln ) stand the 5th level.  == History == [[File:Surrender Japan US China 19.jpg|thumb|ROC take Taiwan in 1945 after Japan Surrendered]] The Nationalists, led by Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]], got rid of the [[Qing Dynasty]] ruled by the [[Manchu]]s, then they established the ROC and ended Imperial Dynastic Rule in late-1911. The ROC at that time had Mainland China and all of what is now called Mongolia.  After the Japanese were defeated by the Allies during [[World War II]], Taiwan was controlled by the ROC.  In 1949, the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] fought a [[civil war|war]] against the Nationalists and won. They established the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Nationalists left mainland China and arrived in Taiwan.  == Politics == After the ROC created a base on Taiwan, it hoped one day to capture the Mainland. But Chinese Communists grew stronger, so the Nationalists never did go back. The Communists say they replaced the ROC as the only government of China and also calls Taiwan their own.  There are those people in Taiwan who want to never be a part of the [[People's Republic of China]].  They believe in complete [[Taiwan independence]] and want to rename the ROC (Taiwan) to "Republic of Taiwan" so Taiwan can no longer have any ancestral connection to China or Chinese culture. Some other people wish to unite with the People's Republic of China; they want [[Chinese reunification]]. Some still want to attack the PRC and reunify China under the Republic of China. Most others want the ''[[status quo]]'', which means keeping everything the way it is now.  == Language == Most Taiwanese people speak the [[Standard Chinese language]] known as [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]], and others speak local dialects such as [[Min Nan]] (Taiwanese) or [[Hakka language|Hakka]]. The [[Cantonese language]], spoken in parts of southern China (for example, the province of [[Guangdong]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]), is not spoken in Taiwan. A small percentage of Aboriginal Taiwanese speak [[aboriginal]] languages, but the rest of the Chinese people have treated them badly, and many of these people, and their languages, struggle to survive. Some older Taiwanese people who went to school while the country was under Japanese rule can speak [[Japanese language|Japanese]].  After the Nationalist government fled the Mainland in 1949, they brought Mandarin and promoted it in Taiwan. Then everyone in the ROC had to learn Mandarin. But, unlike the people in Mainland China, the Taiwanese never changed to [[simplified Chinese characters]] and so they have always used [[traditional Chinese characters]]. In the past, students were not allowed to speak their [[mother tongue]] in school and were expected to speak only Mandarin. Taiwanese, Hakka, and native languages were considered bad until the early 1990s, when education in these languages began to be taught in some school systems. They were promoted, but by this time, many young people could speak only Mandarin.  ==Notes== {{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}  ==References== {{Reflist}}  {{sisterlinks|Republic of China}}  {{asia}} {{Authority control}}  [[Category:Taiwan| ]] [[Category:1949 establishments in Asia]]</text>
