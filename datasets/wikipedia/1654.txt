<title>Qur'an</title><text>{{Islam}} The '''Qur'an''' ({{lang-ar|}}) is the [[holy]] [[book]] of [[Islam]]. The Qur'an is considered by [[Muslim]]s to be "The Word of [[Allah]] ([[God]])". This book is claimed to be different from other [[religion|religious]] texts in that it is said to be the literal words of God, through the [[prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. Some Muslims call it the ''Final Testament''.{{fact|date=August 2018}}  It has been written and read only in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] for more than 1,400 years. But, because many Muslims around the world do not understand Arabic, the meaning of the Qur'an is also given in other languages, so that readers can understand better what the Arabic words in the Qur'an mean. These books are like [[dictionary|dictionaries]] to the Qur'an - they are not read as part of the religion of Islam, to replace the Arabic Qur'an. Muslims believe that these translations are not the true Qur'an; only the Arabic copy is the true Qur'an.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/487666/Quran Qur'an], retrieved on 8 January 2009</ref> The Quran is used with the hadith to interpret [[sharia law]].

The Qur'an was not written all together in book-form while [[Muhammad]] was alive; it was kept by oral communication and brief written records. The prophet did not know how to read nor write, but according to Muslims, the prophet's cousin Ali ibn abi Talib, among others, used to write the texts on something when [[Muhammad]] was alive. After prophet [[Muhammad]] died, Omar ibn Khattab, one of the khulafa u rashidan, compiled the quran into a single book.

After the death of [[Muawiyah]], the Kaaba was hit by catapults by the soldiers of [[Yezid]], the black stone that was hit was divided into three parts, and the Kaaba was destroyed .<ref>Orhan Gkdemir, Din ve Devrim, stanbul: Destek Yaynlar. 2010. s. 64</ref> According to the Canadian archaeologist and researcher of Islamic history [[Dan Gibson]], this destruction took place not in today's city of Mecca, but about 1200 kilometers north of this Petra.  Gibson has found that the qibla walls of the oldest mosques show [[Petra]].<ref>https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/11/3/102/htm</ref> Combining these findings with clues in verse, hadith and sirah sources, Gibson concluded that Muhammad lived in Petra and migrated from here to [[Medina]]. According to him, the first qibla of Muslims was not the Masjid al-Aqsa in [[Jerusalem]], but the Kaaba, which was used as the [[El-Lt]] temple in Petra.  This structure was destroyed during the [[Abdullah bin Zubayr]] uprising among the Muslims [[Second Fitna]].  [[File:Lower city, Petra.jpg|thumb|200px| Lower [[Petra]];According to the Islamic history and archeology researcher [[Dan Gibson]], this was the place where Mohammed lived his youth and received his first revelations. As the first Muslim mosques and cemeteries show, it was also the first [[Qibla]] direction of Muslims.<ref>Dan Gibson: Qur'nic geography: a survey and evaluation of the geographical references in the qurn with suggested solutions for various problems and issues.

The new place, which won the support of [[Abbasids]] who were fighting the Umayyads, was fully adopted after a transition period of several centuries, and the direction of the newly built mosques began to be built towards the new Mecca. However, the mosques in North Africa and Andalusia, which were under the influence of Umayyad, continued to oppose the new qibla by turning their direction in a completely different direction, South Africa. <ref name="bio">Data on Gibson's biography taken from his Web pages, his book ''Qur'nic Geography'' and the Amazon author information to this book: [http://nabataea.net/nabhistory.html] {{Webariv|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200521165215/http://nabataea.net/nabhistory.html |tarih=21 Mays 2020 }} {{|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200521165215/http://nabataea.net/nabhistory.html |tarih=21 Mays 2020 }}, [http://nabataea.net/authors.html] {{Webariv|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408141023/http://nabataea.net/authors.html |tarih=8 Nisan 2018 }} {{|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408141023/http://nabataea.net/authors.html |tarih=8 Nisan 2018 |tarih=8 Nisan 2018 }}, [https://independent.academia.edu/DanGibson1] {{Webariv|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200126144605/https://independent.academia.edu/DanGibson1 |tarih=26 Ocak 2020 }} {{|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200126144605/https://independent.academia.edu/DanGibson1 |tarih=26 Ocak 2020 }}, [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nabataeans-Builders-Petra-Dan-Gibson/dp/1413427340] {{Webariv|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531014144/http://nabataea.net/authors.html |tarih=31 Mays 2017 }} {{|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531014144/http://nabataea.net/authors.html |tarih=31 Mays 2017 }}</ref><ref>Dan Gibson: Qur'nic Geography (2011)</ref>  === Earliest surviving fragments === [[File: Sana'a1 Stanford '07 recto.jpg | thumbnail | right | 100px |The right page of the [[Sana'a manuscript|Stanford '07 binary manuscript]].
