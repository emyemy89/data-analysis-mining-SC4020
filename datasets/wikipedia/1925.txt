He is credited with starting the [[Protestant Reformation]]. As this happened, what are now called [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches split from the [[Roman Catholic]] church. He started the [[Lutheran Church]], the first [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[church]].  == Life ==  Luther studied [[philosophy]] at the University of [[Erfurt]]. In 1505, he entered into the [[Augustinian Order]] as a [[monk]]. Luther studied [[theology]] and ancient languages in Erfurt. In 1512 he became a doctor of theology in [[Wittenberg]] and began his lectures on the [[Psalm]]s and Letters of [[Saint Paul|Paul]].  In October 1517, Luther wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|95 Theses]]. Many people think that he put them on the door of a church in Wittenberg, but this is not sure. Instead, he published a copy. He presented these to church officials at [[Worms Cathedral]].<ref>Kevin Wright, ''The Christian Travel Planner'' (Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson, 2008), p. 155</ref> Luther called them ''The Disputation of Doctor Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences''. It questioned the teaching of the western Church and its ideas about penance, the authority of the [[Pope]] and the usefulness of "[[indulgence]]s". At that time, the Catholic Church was selling indulgences to get out of purgatory, and go right to [[Heaven]] after [[death]].<ref name=Jones>{{cite web|url=http://courses.wcupa.edu/jones/his101/web/37luther.htm|title=Background, Against the Sale of Indulgences by Martin Luther|author=Jim Jones |date=2012 |website= |publisher=West Chester University |accessdate=5 December 2014}}</ref> They were selling [[indulgence]]s for [[money]] for the dead so they could go to Heaven faster.<ref name=Jones/> If that was true, it would mean that poor people would not be able to go to Heaven as quickly, but that the [[priest]]s in the church would be rich from selling these things. Luther thought that this was all wrong, and was against the [[Bible]].  After studying the Letters of Paul, especially the Letter to Romans, Luther came up with an idea called "sola fide". This means that [[faith]] is the only way that people can get [[salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] from [[God]]. According to sola fide, this would mean that many church customs were useless, and should be cast away.  First, Luther believed that he could [[reform]] (change) the Roman Church from the inside (while still being a part of the Church) with his Theses, but the [[Papacy]] took his [[wikt:attitude|attitude]] as [[heresy]] and [[excommunication|excommunicated]] him on [[June 15]] [[1520]] with a paper saying he did not have their permission to go to Heaven. In October, Luther burned the paper in public, and showed he would not obey the Church unless they accepted his words.  Emperor Charles V Opened the imperial [[Diet of Worms]] on [[22 January]] [[1521]] to hear the case. For Luther, it was the last chance to say he had been wrong. But he did not change his mind. The Diet declared Luther an [[outlaw]].<ref>Bratcher, Dennis. "[http://www.crivoice.org/creededictworms.html The Edict of Worms (1521)]," in ''The Voice: Biblical and Theological Resources for Growing Christians''. Retrieved July 13, 2007.</ref>  With the help of a friend, Luther hid in [[Wartburg Castle]], near [[Erfurt]]. In the castle, he [[translation|translated]] the [[Bible]]. First, he wrote the [[New Testament]] in [[German language|German]] instead of the original [[Greek language|Greek]]. Later, he translated the [[Old Testament]] into German, too. Until then, the [[Eucharist|Mass]] and the Bible were in [[Latin]]. Very few people understood it. Most people went to Mass, and did not understand what the priest said because they did not speak Latin. Luther translated the Bible so that more people could read and understand it. That way they were no longer depending on the priest to tell them what was in the Bible, but could read it themselves.  Luther started his own church, called the [[Lutheran Church]], with his friend Philip Melanchthon. Luther died in [[1546]].  == Family ==  From the [[Bible]], Luther formed firm ideas about families. Luther knew that what a child learned at home would greatly [[wikt:influence|influence]] his life. He said in ''Table Talks'', "Sermons very little edify children, who learn little thereby; it is more needful they be taught and well instructed in schools, and at home, and that they be learned and examined what they have learned; this way profits much; 'tis very wearisome, but very necessary".<ref name=sweet>{{cite book |last= Koontz |first= Terri |author2= Mark Sidwell, S.M.Bunker |title= World Studies for Christian Schools |publisher= Bob Jones University Press |location= Greenville, South Carolina 29614 |pages= |isbn= 1-59166-431-4}}</ref> Luther also preached against the [[Catholic Church]]'s demands that ministers cannot marry. After hearing his preaching, many [[nun]]s wrote to him to ask for help in escaping their [[convent]]s. Luther helped nine nuns escape from a convent. On April 4, 1524, Luther had a friend help the nuns sneak over the wall and then hid them in barrels on a wagon until they were out of the city.<ref>{{Cite web  |url=http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/reformation/luther/17.shtml  |title=Martin Luther - Reformation  |work=boisestate.edu  |accessdate=May 25, 2010  |archive-date=May 28, 2010  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528141924/http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/reformation/luther/17.shtml  |url-status=dead  }}</ref> One of these nuns was Katherine von Bora.<ref name=sweet/>  After finding husbands for the nuns whose families would not accept them, Luther had to find a husband for Katherine von Bora. Katherine, however, not only rejected a match Luther arranged for her, but said she would accept only Luther or another pastor named Amsdorf as her husband.  At first Luther did not really like Katherine and thought "she was proud and haughty."<ref name=sweet/> His feelings changed, though, and they married on June 13, 1525.<ref name=sweet/> Luther later said, "And thank [[God]] it hath turned out well; for I have a pious (holy, God-loving) and faithful wife, to whom one may safely commit (give) his heart".<ref name=sweet/>  They had six children. On June 6, 1526, Luther wrote, "I am a happy husband...for from the most precious woman, my best of wives, I have received, by the blessing of God, a little son, John Luther, and, by God's wonderful grace, I have become a [[father]]." <ref name=sweet/>  The firstborn was John Luther. The next was a daughter, Elizabeth; but Elizabeth died when she was just eight months old, and Luther wrote in a letter, "My little daughter Elizabeth is taken from me, and hath left me with a bleeding and almost womanly heart, so sad am I on her account. I never thought the heart of a father was so tender towards his children. Pray the Lord for me."<ref name=sweet/> A third child, Magdalene, also died young. After Magdalene came Martin, then Paul, and finally Margaret.<ref name=sweet/> It was for his children that Luther wrote the Small Catechism<ref name=sweet/> - a book showing the basics of Lutheran beliefs.  == Movies == {{Mainarticle|Luther film}}  Since the time of the [[Silent film|silent movie]]s 28 movies about Martin Luther have been made.
