L. Zamenhof''' and sometimes as the pseudonymous '''Dr. Esperanto''', was an [[eye]] doctor, linguist (who creates a language), and [[wikt:scholar|scholar]] who created the [[International auxiliary language|international language]] [[Esperanto]].  == Biography == Zamenhof was born in 1859 in the town of [[Biaystok]], [[Poland]]. At the time, Poland was a part of the Russian Empire. Bialystok contained three major groups: Poles, Belorussians, and Yiddish-speaking [[Jew]]s. Zamenhof thought that one common language would join these groups and stop fights between them.  His first language was said to be [[Polish language|Polish]]. His parents spoke [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Yiddish]] at home. His father was a [[German language|German]] teacher, so Zamenhof learned that language from an early age and spoke the language fluently. Later he learned [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[English language|English]]. He also had an interest in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]].  Zamenhof decided that the international language must have a simple grammar and be easier to learn than [[Volapk]], an earlier international language. He [[wikt:attempt|attempted]] to create the international language with a grammar that was [[wikt:rich|rich]], and [[wikt:complex|complex]]. The basics of Esperanto were published in 1887.  His grandson, [[Louis-Christophe Zaleski-Zamenhof]], was an engineer.  He was 14 times nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] between [[1907]] and [[1917]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=10372 | title = Nomination Database | date = 2014 | website = Nobelprize.org | publisher = Nobel Media AB | accessdate = 2018-01-13}}</ref>  == References == {{reflist}}   {{person-stub}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Zamenhof, L.
