<title>Military</title><text>[[Image:British Armed Forces personnel on parade crop.jpg|thumb|250px|Members of the British armed forces from the Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and Royal Marines]]  The '''military''' is the group or groups of people that are given power to defend something (mostly a [[country]]). They are armed, so they are called the '''armed forces'''. The military protects its country by [[defense (military)|defending]] it from the armed forces of [[enemy|enemies]], if there is a [[war]]. The military can also be ordered by the government of the country to attack another country. The word "military" comes from Latin ''miles'', warrior.  There are many jobs to do in a military. Some jobs are for fighting and some are for other work to support the military. Some things people do in the military are use [[weapon]]s, drive [[vehicle]]s, and repair weapons. Other people in the military learn how to fly [[aircraft]], pilot [[ship]]s, or repair [[engine]]s. People in the military usually wear [[clothes]] called a [[uniform]]. In some places, especially where there may be combat, a uniform often comes in a [[camouflage]] pattern which is designed to make the person hard to see in the [[forest]] or [[desert]].  There are two ways to join the military. In many countries, people join the military because they want to.  In other countries, there are [[law]]s that some people have to be in the military, even if they do not want to be.  This is called ''the draft'' or ''[[conscription]]''.  It usually depends on age and [[physical fitness]].  Old military people or former military people are called "[[veteran]]<nowiki/>s".  Some are members of a military reserve force.  The military of a country is usually divided into different branches [[organization]]s that do different kinds of work. These branches usually are:  * [[Army]] (land)  A military force of soldiers mainly on land or driving in land [[vehicle]]s. They also use [[helicopter]]s. * [[Navy]] (sea)  A military force that uses [[ship]]s and [[boat]]s. They also sometimes have planes. People in a navy are called [[sailor]]s unless they are officers or pilots. * [[Air force]] (air)  A military force that uses mainly [[airplane]]s.  Sometimes the military has more branches that do more specialized work. For example, in the United States and United Kingdom there are: * [[Marine (military)|Marines]]  Military forces that serve on ships, but are also trained to fight on land when needed. Their main job is to attack by landing on enemy beaches. They work closely with a navy, but are not sailors. They may also have their own boats, planes, and helicopters.  Some big countries even have small units which perform special actions which are very difficult. They are called [[special forces]].  There are also [[mercenary|mercenaries]], soldiers who fight just for pay and have little loyalty to whomever might hire them, and [[private military contractor|private military contractors]] (PMC), which are under the command of a company (civilian company). The Medieval Italian ''condottieri'' were a historical example of PMCs. A [[warlord]] may have a private army, which are often no more trustworthy than common gangsters or criminals.  ==Joining up and training==  In most countries of the world, young men and (in a few countries) women between 17 and 18 and of good health may be forced by the government of their country to join the military and have military training. This is called "conscription". The countries that '''do not''' have conscription include [[Australia]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Hungary]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Malta]], [[New Zealand]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Slovenia]], [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. In some countries, such as [[Argentina]] and [[United States]], conscription is legal but is not used, at the present time.

(This means simply that they put their name on a list.) They have to be above a certain age, 17 or 18 in most countries. They have to pass [[physical fitness]] tests to show that they are well enough to do the jobs that they will have to do. They must also have good enough hearing, to hear orders, and good enough sight to use a [[rifle]].   New people in the military are often called recruits. They have [[training]] at a special camp, sometimes called boot camp" or "basic training". During this training, the recruits usually have very little free time. They learn to understand the "orders" or "commands" that are given by the officers to the "troops". (The troops are the military people in a group.) They learn the right ways to obey the orders. They do a lot of [[exercise]] to improve their fitness and strength. They learn about [[weapons]], [[first aid]], and their uniforms and "kit". (Their kit is their equipment.) Recruits also learn how to march. (This is the way to walk together, keeping "in step".) Learning to march is sometimes called drill. By the time soldiers finish "boot camp", they should know enough to be a helpful person in their group. The camp usually finishes with a [[parade]] in which the newly trained recruits show off their marching and other skills they have learned in front of important visitors. Once the recruits are fully trained, they are ready to defend (protect) their country from attack, or to go to [war], if necessary.  == Largest armed forces (2002 estimate) == {| wikitable |- | Nation | Army | Navy | Air Force | Total |- | [[China]] | 1,700,000 | 220,000 | 420,000 | 2,340,000 |- | [[United States]] | 471,700 | 370,700 | 353,600 | 1,365,800* |- | [[India]] | 1,100,000 | 53,000 | 150,000 | 1,303,000 |- | [[North Korea]] | 950,000 | 46,000 | 86,000 | 1,082,000 |- | [[Russia]] | 348,000 | 171,500 | 184,600 | 1,004,100** |- | [[South Korea]] | 560,000 | 60,000 | 63,000 | 683,000 |- | [[Pakistan]] | 550,000 | 22,000 | 40,000 | 612,000 |- | [[Turkey]] | 495,000 | 54,600 | 60,100 | 609,700 |- | [[Iran]] | 325,000 | 18,000 | 45,000 | 513,000*** |}  <nowiki>*</nowiki>includes 169,800 [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]<br/> <nowiki>**</nowiki>includes Strategic Deterrent Forces, Paramilitary, National Guard, etc.<br/> <nowiki>***</nowiki>includes 125,000 Revolutionary Guards   [[Category:Military| ]] {{Law}} {{authority control}}</text>
