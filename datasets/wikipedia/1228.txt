<title>Sphere</title><text>[[File:Sphere wireframe 10deg 3r.svg|right|thumb|An image of a sphere]]  A '''sphere''' is a [[shape]] in space that is like the [[surface]] of a [[ball]]. Most of the time, the terms ball and sphere are used as the same. But in [[mathematics]], the precise (exact) definition only allows points in the 3 dimensional space which are uniformly and symmetrically located at a fixed length called radius of the sphere.  Examples of these are basketballs, superballs, and playground balls.  A sphere is the 3 dimensional analogue of a circle.  == Volume ==  The volume (V) of a sphere is given by the following formula :<math>\!V = \frac{4 \pi r^3}{3}</math>  where ''r'' is the radius of the sphere. ==Surface area==  The surface area (A) of a sphere is given by the following formula  :<math>\!A =4 \pi r^2</math>  where ''r'' is the radius of the sphere.  == Equation of a sphere == In Cartesian co-ordinates, the equation for a sphere with a center at (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>, z<sub>0</sub>) is as follows:  <math>(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2 = r^2</math>  where r is the radius of the sphere.  {{Math-stub}}  [[Category:Three-dimensional shapes]]</text>
