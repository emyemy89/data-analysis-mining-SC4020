The biggest buildings in the original World Trade Center were the Twin Towers. The North Tower was the tallest building in the world when it was built. Taller ones were built later. The Twin Towers had 110 stories, and, at the time of its destruction, were the two tallest in New York. They and 7 World Trade Center were destroyed in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and other buildings were damaged beyond repair.  The original World Trade Center was designed by Minoru Yamasaki in the early 1960s using a tube-frame structural design for the twin 110-story towers. In gaining approval for the project, the Port Authority of [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]] agreed to take over the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad which became the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH).  Groundbreaking for the World Trade Center took place on August 5, 1966. The North Tower, officially World Trade Center 1 was completed in December 1970 and the South Tower, officially World Trade Center 2 was finished in July 1971. Construction of the World Trade Center involved excavating a large amount of material that was then used in making [[Battery Park City]] on the west side of [[Lower Manhattan]].  == WTC buildings == * [[One World Trade Center|1 World Trade Center]] (North Tower) * [[2 World Trade Center]] (South Tower) * [[Marriott World Trade Center|3 World Trade Center]] (Marriott Vista Hotel) * [[4 World Trade Center]] * [[5 World Trade Center]] * [[6 World Trade Center]] (US Customs House) * [[7 World Trade Center]]  == Terrorist attacks ==  === [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|February 26, 1993, bombing]] === [[File:WTC 1993 ATF Commons.jpg|left|thumb|Underground bombing aftermath]] The first terrorist attack on the World Trade Center occurred on February 26, 1993, at 12:17 PM. A truck filled with 680&nbsp;kg of explosives, planted by Ramzi Yousef, exploded in the underground garage of the 1 WTC. The bombing created a 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft) hole through five sublevels. Six people were killed and 1,042 others were injured during escape attempts. Many people inside the tower were forced to walk down darkened stairwells with no emergency lighting, some taking two hours or more to reach safety. As a memorial to the victims of the bombing of the tower, a [[reflecting pool]] was installed with the names of those who were killed.  ===[[September 11 attacks]]=== [[File:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11.jpeg|left|thumb|[[United Airlines Flight 175]] crashes into the south tower, with the north tower already burning.]] On September 11, 2001, [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists hijacked [[American Airlines Flight 11]] and crashed it into the 1 WTC, striking between the 93rd and 99th floors, killing 1,344 people. Seventeen minutes later, a second group crashed the hijacked [[United Airlines Flight 175]] into the WTC, striking between the 77th and 85th floors, fewer than 700 were killed. At 5:20&nbsp;p.m., [[7 World Trade Center]] started to collapse with the crumble of the east penthouse. The [[3 World Trade Center|Vista Hotel]] was destroyed during the collapse of the twin towers. The three remaining buildings in the WTC plaza were damaged by debris and later were demolished. Many [[conspiracy theories]] have appeared which say that certain people in the United States government knew about the attacks beforehand, or even made them happen.  ==== Memorials ==== [[File:WTCmemorialJune2012.png|thumb|The [[National September 11 Memorial & Museum]]. The [[reflecting pool]]s are on the site of the Twin Towers.]] The '''National September 11 Memorial & Museum''' (also known as the '''9/11 Memorial & Museum''') is a memorial and museum in [[World Trade Center site]], as the memorial of the 9/11 attacks, which killed 2,977 people, and the 1993 bombing, which killed six. It is operated by a non-profit institution whose mission is to raise funds for, program, and operate the memorial and museum at the World Trade Center site. The National September 11 Memorial opened on September 11, 2011, and the museum opened in May 2014.  {{World Trade Center}}  == References == {{reflist}}  == Other websites == * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgaVcOmjPM4 "The Lost Days" - videotribute] * [http://worldtradecenter.110mb.com/ Apocalypse in the USA  animation, WTC and Pentagon, Ground Zero] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820075749/http://worldtradecenter.110mb.com/ |date=2007-08-20 }} * [http://brasil.indymedia.org/pt/blue/2012/05/507082.shtml Nicol Prism - The new version of the twin towers, WTC members of the architectural complex, is inaugurated on 1 May 2012 without much fanfare.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924060244/http://brasil.indymedia.org/pt/blue/2012/05/507082.shtml |date=24 September 2015 }}  [[Category:1973 establishments in New York (state)]] [[Category:2001 disestablishments in the United States]] [[Category:Buildings and structures in Manhattan]] [[Category:September 11 attacks]] [[Category:World Trade Organization]]  {{US-geo-stub}} {{authority control}} [[fi:World Trade Center]]</text>
