The King of Prussia and the Emperor of Germany lived in Berlin. The government of Germany was in Berlin for many years. Bombs destroyed many buildings in the city in [[World War II|World War Two]]. The city was split into [[West Berlin]] and [[East Berlin]] after World War Two. After the [[Berlin Wall]] was built in 1961 very few people were allowed to cross from East Berlin into West Berlin. The wall divided the city until 1989 when the East German government decided to allow anyone to cross, and people decided to destroy the wall.  == Boroughs == {{main|Boroughs of Berlin}} [[File:Berlin.bezirke.png|thumb|right|map of the berlin boroughs]]  In 2001 the 23 boroughs of Berlin were changed into 12  # [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]] # [[Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg]] # [[Lichtenberg-Hohenschnhausen]] # [[Marzahn-Hellersdorf]] # [[Berlin-Mitte|Mitte]] (Central) # [[Neuklln]] # [[Pankow]] # [[Reinickendorf]] # [[Spandau]] # [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]] # [[Tempelhof-Schneberg]] # [[Treptow-Kpenick]]  == Sights == * [[Alexanderplatz]] (with the Television Tower) * [[Berliner Dom]] (Berlin's [[cathedral]]) * [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]] (the new main Railway station) * [[Brandenburg Gate]] * [[Fernsehturm]] (the TV tower - the highest building in Germany) * [[Potsdamer Platz]] * [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] (home of the [[Bundestag]]) * [[Rotes Rathaus]] (office of the Governing Mayor) * [[Strae des 17.
