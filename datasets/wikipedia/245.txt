It is also near [[Sri Lanka]], an [[island]] country.  India is a [[peninsula]], which means that it is surrounded on three sides by water. One of the seven wonders of the world is in Agra: the Taj Mahal. In the west is the [[Arabian Sea]], in the south is the [[Indian Ocean]], and in the east is the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The northern part of India has many mountains. The most famous mountain range in India is the [[Himalayas]], which have some of the tallest [[mountain]]s in the world. There are many rivers in India. The main rivers are the [[Ganges]], the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]], the [[Yamuna]], the Godavari, the Kaveri, the Narmada, and the Krishna.

There is very heavy [[rainfall]] along the west coast and in the Eastern Himalayan foothills. The west, though, is drier. Because of some of the [[desert]]s of India, all of India gets rain for four months of the year. That time is called the monsoon. That is because the deserts attract water-filled winds from the Indian Ocean, which give rain when they come into India. When the monsoon rains come late or not so heavily, [[drought]]s (when the land dries out because there is less rain) are possible. Monsoons normally come around July - August.  == Defence == {{Main|Indian Armed Forces}} The '''Indian Armed Forces''' is the military of India.
