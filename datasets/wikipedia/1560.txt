<title>Organic compound</title><text>[[Image:Methane-2D-stereo.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Methane]] is one of the simplest organic compounds]] '''Organic compounds''' are [[carbon]]-based [[chemical compound|compounds]]. Organic compounds contain carbon bonds in which at least one carbon atom is [[covalent bond|covalently]] linked to an atom of another type (usually [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]] or [[nitrogen]]). Most [[polymers]] are organic compounds.  == History == The name "{{broken wikt link|organic|organic}}" is a historical name from the [[19th century]].  People believed that only living things could make organic compounds and "dead" things (such as [[mineral]]s) could make [[inorganic compound]]s. However, Friedrich Whler proved this wrong by synthesizing [[urea]], a well-known organic compound. [[File:Acetaldehyd 8150.JPG|thumb|Another kind of model of a different compound]]  == Kinds of organic compounds == There are natural organic compounds, and synthetic ones. Their structure may be described by using names, and making [[diagram]]s.   One way of showing the [[molecule]] is by drawing its structural formula. Because molecules can have complicated structures, people have made ways to show them in simple language. One way is to use line diagrams. Each atom is shown by a letter, and connected by a line to each atom with which it is has a [[covalent bond]]. One line means a single bond, two lines means a double bond and so on.   Because there is in an infinite number of possible organic compounds, language is needed to give a unique name to each one. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, or [[IUPAC]], made a system for doing this. Although an IUPAC name makes every single possible molecule unique, the names are often long and complicated, so in everyday life, ''trivial'' names--unofficial but widely understood names--are used, such as the trivial names [[Paracetamol]], Tylenol, and Acetaminophen, which are used for a compound whose IUPAC name is ''N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) [[acetamide]]''. Some of these trivial names are [[trademark]]s.  === Natural Compounds === Natural compounds are compounds made by living beings. These could also be made in a lab, but many of these compounds are taken from nature because it is easier and less expensive to do it that way. For example, every year people grow and eat huge amounts of natural [[sugar]] and [[starch]]. Other common natural compounds are: [[amino acid]]s, [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrates]], many [[antibiotics]] like [[Penicillin]] and [[Amoxicillin]].  === Synthetic compounds === Synthetic compounds are those made by people. Sometimes, this is done by taking something natural and changing the molecule in a small way, such as making [[glycerine|glycerin]] from vegetable oils. Other compounds are synthesized in long, complicated reactions with many steps. [[Plastics]] are sometimes mostly natural, and other kinds are [[manufacture]]d.  == Structure == Since a compound is often first discovered in nature instead of being made on purpose in a lab, people may know the compound exists, and even know what it does sometimes, but not know exactly what atoms it is made of and how it is arranged. There are several ways of taking an unknown compound and finding out this structure: * [[Mass spectrometry]] * [[X-ray]] [[diffraction]] * Nuclear [[magnetic resonance]] spectroscopy * [[Infrared]] [[spectroscopy]]  == Related pages == *[[Acetone]] *[[Inorganic compound]] *[[Organic chemistry]] *[[Biochemistry]]  == Other websites == * [http://homework.chem.uic.edu/NEXT.HTM Organic chemistry online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213015202/http://homework.chem.uic.edu/NEXT.HTM |date=2013-12-13 }}  [[Category:Organic compounds| ]]</text>
