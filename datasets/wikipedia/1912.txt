<title>The Young and the Restless</title><text>{{italictitle}} '''''The Young and the Restless''''' is a very popular [[United States|America]]n [[soap opera]]. The show is the highest-rated soap opera, which means that more people watch it than any other soap opera. It aired its first episode on March 26, 1973. It is set in [[fiction]]al [[Genoa City]], [[Wisconsin]]. In the beginning, the show was about the Brooks family, who were very rich, and the Foster family, who were poor. Today, very few members of either family are still on the show.  Today, the show tells stories about two [[cosmetics]] companies: '''Newman Enterprises''' and '''Jabot Cosmetics'''. Newman's president is Victor Newman (played by the actor Eric Braeden) and Jabot's president is Jack Abbott (played by Peter Bergman). These two men hate each other very much and would like to see the other fail. This hatred is the root of much of the story on the show.  ==List of actors/characters on the show== {| class=wikitable ![[Actor]]!![[Fictional character|Role]] |- | Hunter Allan || Noah Newman |- | Peter Bergman || Jack Abbott |- | Vail Bloom || Heather Stevens |- | Eric Braeden || Victor Newman |- | Tracey E.
