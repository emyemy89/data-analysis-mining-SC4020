<title>Plural</title><text>In [[linguistics]], [[noun phrase]]s have [[grammatical number]]. '''Plural''' is one kind of grammatical number. In English, '''plural''' noun phrases are counted as more or less than one (e.g., ''-32 degrees, no bananas'', ''0.5 liters'', ''1.2 grams'', ''two times'', ''three fish'', ''20 mothers''). In contrast, a singular noun phrase usually refers to something that you would count as one only (e.g., ''one time'', ''a glass'', ''the sun'', ''my mother'', ''Jennifer''). Noun phrases that cannot be counted are also singular in English (e.g., ''water'', ''the meat'', ''some space'', etc.).  In many languages, a [[suffix]] (word ending) is added to a word to show that the word is plural. In [[English language|English]], the normal plural [[suffix]] ''i''s ''-s'' (e.g., ''cat'' is singular, and ''cat'''s''''' is plural).  == Plurals in English == There are a number of exceptions:<ref>Crystal, David 1995.

''A dictionary of modern English usage''. 2nd ed, revised by Sir Ernest Gowers. Oxford: Clarendon Press, p456.</ref> *Singulars ending in <u>s</u> are usually the same in plural: ''species'', ''mumps'', ''innings'' and so on. But proper names ending in 's' take add 'es' in plural: ''Jones'' becomes ''the Joneses''.  *Compound words add the plural to the noun part: <u>sons</u>-in-law, Lord <u>Mayors</u>, <u>Courts</u> Martial. *Singulars ending in <u>y</u> become <u>ies</u> in plural if a [[consonant]] is before the suffix. So <u>day</u> becomes <u>days</u>, but <u>spy</u> becomes <u>spies</u>. Personal names are again an exception: the plural of <u>Mary</u> is <u>Marys</u>. *Singulars ending in <u>f</u> usually changes to <u>ves</u>: dwarf to dwarves, leaf to leaves, and so on. *Special cases: some plurals just have to be learnt. The plural of ''person'' is normally ''people'', but sometimes ''persons'' is used. *Invariant nouns: <br/>The [[common name]]s of animals is often used as both singular and plural. One can say "We shot grouse today" correctly no matter what number were killed. With "fish" there is a choice. Traditional English usage is that the word is used for both singular and plural, but American usage seems to prefer <u>fishes</u> as the plural. <br/>With groups of animals, one uses the singular, as in a herd of bison or a [[shoal]] of herring. But if the animals are known as individuals then, for example, we feed the ducks, or stroke our cats. There are other cases where there is no plural at all, as with sheep, salmon, deer. <br/>Other general words which add no suffix in plural are ''aircraft'' and ''offspring''. Some look like singular but are always plural, such as ''vermin'', ''livestock'', ''cattle'', ''people''.  It is fair to say that most native English speakers do make mistakes in this area: it is one of the more troublesome aspects of the English language.  == Other languages == All European languages have plural forms. The suffix that is used in each one of these other languages is different from the suffix that is applied to [[English language|English]] nouns.  In other languages, such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], there is usually no plural ending.  == References == {{reflist}}  [[Category:Grammar]]</text>
