<title>Open source</title><text>'''Open source''' is a software similar to [[free software]], but is more related to [[business]].<ref>{{Cite journal| publisher = Stanford University| last = O'Mahony| first = Siobhan Clare| title = The emergence of a new commercial actor: Community managed software projects| location = Stanford, CA| date = 2002|pages=3442}}</ref> It is different from other software because the [[source code]] is available to everyone. The source code is a set of instructions for the computer, written in a [[programming language]].  Anyone can see how the source code works and can change it if they want to make it work differently. The [[opposite]] of open source is [[closed source]]. Closed source software is not available to everyone. Open source has a lot in common with free software but each has its own focus and goals.  Open source and free software have been around for [[decade]]s. They became more popular with the [[Linux]] and [[BSD]] software [[community|communities]].  To protect the code, a special [[user license]] is used. The most common kinds of licence are the [[GPL]], [[BSD]] and [[LGPL]]. [[Wikipedia]] uses open source too. The Open Source Movement is led by the [[Open Source Initiative]].  The open source movement became separate from the free software movement in 1998.  ==Examples== ===Computing=== * [[GNU Octave]]<ref>Hansen, J. S. (2011).
