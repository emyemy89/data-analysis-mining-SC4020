It was fought between [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]]. North Vietnam was supported by the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]] and [[North Korea]], while South Vietnam was supported by the [[United States]], South Korea, [[Thailand]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[Philippines]]. People from other countries also went to fight but not in their own national army. This conflict between [[communist]] and [[capitalist]] countries was part of the [[Cold War]].  The [[Viet Cong]] (also known as the National Liberation Front, or NLF), was a South Vietnamese communist force helped by the North. It fought a [[guerrilla war]] against the anti-communist forces in the South. The [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (also known as the North Vietnamese Army) engaged in a more conventional war, at times putting large forces to battle.  The Vietnam War was very [[Controversy|controversial]], especially in the United States, and it was the first war to feature live television coverage. It was also the first major [[War|armed conflict]] that the United States lost. The war became so unpopular in the United States that President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] eventually agreed to send American soldiers home in 1973.  == Background and causes == {{multiple image  | align     = right  | direction = horizontal  | image1    = Victory in Battle of Dien Bien Phu.jpg  | width1    = 242  | caption1  = Viet Minh wave their flag over a captured French bunker at Dien Bien Phu in 1954.

Communist-controlled North Vietnam is in red; most  of the ground-fighting was in the South. }} [[France]] began to [[Colony|colonize]] Vietnam between 1859 and 1862, when they took control of [[Saigon]]. By 1864 they controlled all of Cochinchina, the [[south]]ern part of Vietnam. France took control of Annam, the large central part of Vietnam, in 1874. After France defeated [[China]] in the Sino-French war (18841885), they took over Tonkin, the [[North Vietnam|northern]] part of Vietnam. [[French Indochina]] was formed in October 1887 from these three areas of Vietnam (Cochinchina, Annam and Tonkin), as well as the [[Cambodia|Kingdom of Cambodia]]. [[Laos]] was added after a war with Thailand, the [[Franco-Siamese War]], in 1893.  During [[World War II]], after [[Nazi Germany]] defeated the French in 1940, French Indochina was controlled by the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] government, a [[Puppet state|puppet government]] approved by Nazi Germany. In March 1945 Imperial [[Japan]] launched the Second French Indochina Campaign. Japan occupied Indochina until their surrender in August 1945.  After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Vichy government was no longer in control of France or its territories. The newly formed Provisional Government of the French Republic attempted to take back control of its former colonies in Indochina by force if necessary. But the French efforts at regaining their colony in Vietnam were opposed by a Vietnamese army called the [[Viet Minh]].  [[File:Ho Chi Minh 1946.jpg|left|120px|thumb|{{center|[[H Ch Minh]]}}]]  The [[Vietnamese Independence League|Viet Minh]] had been founded in 1941 by the [[communist party]] and was led by [[Ho Chi Minh|H Ch Minh]]. This led to the [[First Indochina War]] between France and the Viet Minh. The fighting started with the French [[bombardment]] of [[Haiphong|Haiphong Harbor]] in November 1946 and ended with a triumph of the Viet Minh at [[Battle of in Bin Ph|Dien Bien Phu]].  In July 1954, France and the Viet Minh signed the [[Geneva Peace Accord]].  This resulted in dividing Vietnam along the 17th parallel into a northern section, under the control of the communists led by Ho Chi Minh as president, and a southern section led by the Catholic anti-communist [[Ngo Dinh Diem]].  The partition was to be temporary until elections in 1956. However, Diem started arresting suspected communist sympathizers in 1956 to keep power for himself. The elections were never held, and in 1957 the north Vietnamese began [[guerrilla warfare]] against the south.  The United States supported the anti-communist government in South Vietnam. It began to send [[military advisor]]s to help [[Training|train]] and support the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnamese army]]. The South was fighting against the Viet Cong, a communist party based in South Vietnam which was allied with North Vietnam. The Viet Cong began a campaign of [[assassination]] in 1957. In 1959, North Vietnam dramatically increased its military assistance to the Viet Cong, which then began attacking South Vietnamese military units. In the American [[domino theory]] they feared that if communism took hold in Vietnam, it would spread to other countries nearby.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/domino-theory |title=Domino Theory |author= |website= |publisher=History/A&E Television Networks, LLC |accessdate=8 March 2016}}</ref>  ==Gulf of Tonkin Resolution== [[File:USS Maddox (DD-731) underway at sea, circa the early 1960s (NH 97900).jpg|thumb|left|120px|{{Center|The destroyer USS ''Maddox''}}]] On 2 August 1964, the destroyer USS ''Maddox'' was in the Gulf of Tonkin, on an intelligence mission along North Vietnam's coast. The US said that three North Vietnamese torpedo boats attacked the destroyer. The Maddox fired back and damaged the three torpedo boats. The US then claimed that two days later, the torpedo boats again attacked the ''Maddox'' and the destroyer USS ''Turner Joy''. In this  second attack the US ships did not actually see the torpedo boats, but said they had found them using the ship's radar.  After the alleged second attack the U.S. launched air strikes against North Vietnam. The Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin [[Joint resolution|Joint Resolution]] (H.J. RES 1145) on 7 August 1964. This gave the president the power to run large-scale military operations in Southeast Asia without declaring war. There was little to no proof of these attacks and it was believed by some that they were an excuse for expanded U.S. involvement in Indochina.  The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong were supplied by a vast network of hidden trails, known as the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/battlefieldvietnam/guerrilla/ |title=Guerrilla Tactics: An Overview |author= |website=Battlefield: Vietnam |publisher=PBS |accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref> Which was hidden very well and many attempts were made by the U.S. to bomb and destroy it. Supplies and soldiers from North Vietnam were sent through Laos to communists forces in South Vietnam. American planes heavily bombed the Ho Chi Minh Trail; {{convert|3000000|ST}} of bombs were dropped on Laos.<ref name=hcmtUSHIST>{{cite web |url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1875.html |title=Ho Chi Minh Trail |author= |website=United States History |publisher=U-S-HISTORY.COM |accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref> It slowed down but did not stop the trail system.<ref name=hcmtUSHIST/>  Severe communist losses during the 1968 [[Tet Offensive]], made it possible for the U.S. to withdraw many soldiers. As part of a policy called "Vietnamization", South Vietnamese troops were trained and equipped to replace the Americans who left. By 1973, 95 percent of the American troops were gone.  A [[peace treaty]] was signed in Paris in January 1973 by all the parties, but fighting continued until 1975.  ==Guerilla warfare== {{multiple image  | align     = center  | direction = horizontal  | image1    = Vietcong tunnels-USAR.jpg  | width1    = 330  | caption1  = <p>Cross-sectional diagram showing an example of a section of tunnel system used by the Vietcong during the Vietnam War.</p> <p> The area with the most tunnels was called the Iron Triangle by the Americans.

This type of warfare is different from the large-scale battles fought between armies, like those in World War II.[[File:Viet Cong002.jpg|thumb|left|{{center|Captured photo showing Vietcong troops traveling in flat-bottomed boats called sampans}}]][[File:173d Airborne Brigade- Vietnam War-Hill 823.jpg|thumb|left|{{center|US Airborne troops under attack during the Battle of Dak To (1967)}}]]In guerilla warfare, small units fight limited battles against an enemy force, set up ambushes, make surprise attacks, and then retreat back into the countryside or blend into the local population. It also includes making it difficult for the enemy to operate by engaging in sabotage and harassing the enemy with lethal means such as [[land mine]]<nowiki/>s and [[booby trap]]<nowiki/>s. The communist troops more often engaged in guerilla warfare against the South Vietnamese and American troops.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.pbs.org/battlefieldvietnam/guerrilla/index.html |title=Battlefield:Vietnam &#124; Guerrilla Tactics |work=pbs.org |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>  Although most traps were non-explosive, there were a few explosive traps which all used grenades. A trip wire was placed and if a soldier tripped over the wire, a grenade pin was pulled out and the grenade would blow, killing the soldier.  Another style of trap was nicknamed Venus Flytrap. It had about eight barbs attached to a rectangular frame sitting on a small hole. The barbs were facing down so when the soldiers leg got caught in it, it wouldnt hurt until he pulled his leg out. When he pulled his leg out the barbs would rip through his leg.  Another Vietcong trap was the Punji trap. Two wooden platforms were placed and covered with leaves to camouflage it. There were spikes on the inside of the wood. When a soldier came along and walked on the wood, it caved in and the spikes would go through the soldiers foot. These traps were the most common because they were the cheapest and very effective. They also were often [[wikt:contaminated|contaminated]] (often with feaces) so that the soldier would also become infected.  Besides hurting or killing people, these traps were good at causing fear and lowering soldier morale.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://vietnam-warfare.tripod.com/vietnamwarfare/id3.html |title= Booby Traps |work= Mcdonald College |year= 2004 [last update] |accessdate= May 30, 2012 |archive-date= May 24, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120524055043/http://vietnam-warfare.tripod.com/vietnamwarfare/id3.html |url-status= dead }}</ref>  ==Fall of Saigon== [[File:Vietnamese refugees on US carrier, Operation Frequent Wind.jpg|thumb|150px|{{center|Vietmanese refugees fleeing from communist forces, on an American aircraft carrier off the coast of Vietnam on April 29, 1975, the day before the complete fall of Saigon}}]] The Fall of Saigon was the capture of Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, by the People's Army of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front on April 30, 1975. This marked the end of the Vietnam War and the beginning of the formal reunification of Vietnam into a communist state.  Before the city fell the few American civilian and military personnel left Vietnam, along with tens of thousands of South Vietnamese soldiers and civilians had fled.  North Vietnamese forces under the command of General [[Vn Tin Dng]] began their final attack on Saigon, which was commanded by General Nguyen Van Toan on April 29, with a heavy artillery bombardment of Tn Sn Nht Airport which killed the last two American servicemen who died in Vietnam, Charles McMahon and Darwin Judge.  By the afternoon of the next day, North Vietnamese troops had occupied the important points within the city and raised their flag over the South Vietnamese presidential palace. The government of South Vietnam formally gave up shortly after.  Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City, after communist leader Ho Chi Minh.  Any Americans that were in Saigon at the time were evacuated by helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft. The surrender of Saigon was told by the South Vietnamese president himself, General [[Dng Vn Minh|Duong Van Minh]]. He said "We are here to hand over to you the power in order to avoid bloodshed." General Minh had become South Vietnams president for two days as the country crumbled.  ==Related pages== *[[First Indochina War]] *[[Weapons of the Vietnam War]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==Other websites== {{commons}} *[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3798581.stm The herbicide Agent Orange has left a lasting legacy on Vietnam]  [[Category:Vietnam War| ]] [[Category:Cold War]] [[Category:20th century in Vietnam]] [[Category:1950s in Asia]] [[Category:1960s in Asia]] [[Category:1970s in Asia]]</text>
