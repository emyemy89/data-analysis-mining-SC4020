<title>Plato</title><text>[[File:Plato.png|thumb|right|Bust of Plato]]  '''Plato''' was one of the most important classical [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]]s. He lived from 427 [[BC]] to 348 BC. A wealthy man, he owned at least 50 [[Slavery|slaves]] and created the first [[university]] school, called "[[The Academy]]".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-GFUyty3SAC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=%22plato+owned+fifty+slaves%22&source=bl&ots=7gXg5hcNGF&sig=ACfU3U3YsZCY21qBgb_TEtblSgva-zoePQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi0r8Get7TtAhXzUjUKHe8iCTwQ6AEwBXoECAgQAg#v=onepage&q=%22plato%20owned%20fifty%20slaves%22&f=false|title=The History of White People|last=Painter|first=Nell Irvin|date=2011-04-18|publisher=W.

Plato wrote about many ideas in philosophy that are still talked about today. He wrote about ideas of [[deductive reasoning]]. One modern philosopher, [[Alfred North Whitehead]], said that all philosophy since Plato has just been comments on his works.  Plato wrote his books in the form of [[dialogue]]s with two people or more talking about ideas, and sometimes disagreeing about them. The ''[[Laws (Plato)|Laws]]'' is Plato's longest dialogue and probably his last.<ref>{{cite book|title=Platos Laws: A Critical Guide|url=https://archive.org/details/platoslawscritic00bobo|last=Bobonich|first=Christopher|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88463-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/platoslawscritic00bobo/page/n10 1]}}</ref>  Socrates is usually the main person in Plato's dialogues. Usually, Socrates talks with people about their ideas, and tries to see if they believe anything that is [[logic|illogical]]. Other people in the stories often become angry with Socrates because of this. People who study Plato argue about whether Socrates really said the same things that Plato makes him say, or whether Plato just used Socrates as a character, to make the ideas he was talking about seem more important.  Plato opposed the [[rhetoric]]s of [[sophism]] and insisted on true [[justice]] and [[equality]] in his work ''Gorgias'', and on [[immortality]] of [[soul]] in ''Phaedo''.  One of Plato's most famous works is ''[[The Republic]]'' (in [[Greek language|Greek]], ''Politeia,'' or 'city'). In that work, he describes Socrates's vision of an "[[idealism|ideal]]" [[state]]. The method of questioning in this dialogue, called the [[Socratic method]], is as important as the content. ''The Republic'' contains ideas of Socrates: "Socrates said it, Plato wrote it."  == Works by Plato == There are many dialogues that were supposed to be written by Plato.
