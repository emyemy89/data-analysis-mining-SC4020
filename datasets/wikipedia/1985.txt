They officially said the Wright brothers flight was [http://www.wright-house.com/wright-brothers/wrights/1903.html "the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight"].</ref> They had been experimenting for many years with gliders and other vehicles before their first powered [[flight]]. They are also known for making the first way to steer an airplane. They designed the [[aircraft]] in Dayton, Ohio, and their first test flight was in [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina]].   == Before building airplanes == The Wrights grew up in [[Dayton, Ohio]].  They were sons of a [[clergy|minister]].<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11372/ |title = Telegram from Orville Wright in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, to His Father Announcing Four Successful Flights, 1903 December 17 |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1903-12-17 |accessdate = 2013-07-22 }}</ref>  There were many books in their house, and they were encouraged to ask questions and find out about whatever they thought was interesting. Sometimes their father would ask them to argue for a topic, then switch sides and argue for the opposite point of view.  They went to high school, but did not go to college; they started a [[newspaper]] instead.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/daav/chap4.htm What Dreams We Have]</ref>  After that, they started a shop to build and repair [[bicycle]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Wright_Bros/wright_family/WR1G5.htm |title=The Van Cleve Bicycle that the Wrights Built and Sold |publisher=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission |accessdate=2009-05-22 |archive-date=2012-10-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008031801/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Wright_Bros/wright_family/WR1G5.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>  == Learning how to fly == By the 1890s, the Wrights were interested in flight, especially the [[glider]]s of [[Otto Lilienthal]].  They started working on making airplanes in their bicycle shop.<ref name="WDL3">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11373/ |title = Wilbur Wright Working in the Bicycle Shop |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1897 |accessdate = 2013-07-22 }}</ref> They thought controlling a plane was one of the big problems of flight. Lilienthal and others had been killed when they could not control their [[aircraft]]. The Wright brothers fixed the problem by inventing control surfaces, such as a [[rudder]] that would work in the air. They built wings that could be twisted a little<ref>''The Bishop's Boys'', Tom D. Crouch, 2003, W.W. Norton & Co., p. 201. ("Wing-warping").</ref> and moved up and down slightly, to control flight.  They called this steering system ''wing-warping''.  From 1900 to 1902, they built gliders in Dayton and tested them in Kitty Hawk, where there were strong and steady winds. They also made small versions of the wings and built a wind tunnel for [[model airplane]]s to test how well different wing shapes would lift an airplane.  == Flying == In 1903, they built a powered airplane that had [[propeller]]s and a small engine. The ''Wright Flyer'' airplane first flew successfully on [[December 17]], [[1903]], near [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina]].<ref name="WDL"/> This was the first time people ever flew a powered airplane they could control.  Before that, people flew in balloons or gliders, or for a very short time in planes they could not control. The two brothers continued to make changes to their design and had a very good plane by 1905. [[Image:Wrightflyer.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Picture of the first flight with Orville Wright at the controls and Wilbur Wright running beside it.]]  The Wright Brothers kept their discovery largely secret for a couple of years, until they showed it to the world in 1908<ref>"L'Aerophile," August 11, 1908, quoted in Crouch, p. 368. Demonstration flights were made Aug. 8-15, 1908. (Crouch, p. 366-7.).</ref> (They had filed a patent on their steering system March 23, 1903.)<ref name=Wright>{{Citation  | title = Flying-Machine   | url = http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT821393&id=h5NWAAAAEBAJ&dq=821,393  | author = Wright, Orville  | journal = U.S. Patent  821393  | accessdate = 2010-03-19 }}</ref>    After that, they started a company to build airplanes.  They had a patent war with [[Glenn Curtiss]], filing lawsuits against each other over who really invented the airplane steering system.  The Wrights believed that Curtiss' [[aileron]] system was too similar to their own steering system and that he had copied them.  During the patent war, Wilbur died.  Orville continued working to keep his reputation as the first man to fly. Later he sold the airplane company and became an elder statesman of aviation. He died in 1948.<br><br><br><br>  == References == {{reflist}}  [[Category:American aviators]] [[Category:American inventors]] [[Category:Sibling duos]] [[Category:Business people from Dayton, Ohio]]</text>
