<title>Subtraction</title><text>'''Subtraction''' is the [[arithmetic]] operation for finding the [[wikt:difference|difference]] between two [[number]]s, though it can also be generalized to other mathematical objects such as [[Vector|vectors]] and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-03-25|title=Comprehensive List of Algebra Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/algebra-symbols/|access-date=2020-08-26|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}}</ref> The special names of the numbers in a subtraction expression are, minuend - subtrahend = difference.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Subtraction|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Subtraction.html|access-date=2020-08-26|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Subtraction|url=https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/subtraction.html|access-date=2020-08-26|website=www.mathsisfun.com}}</ref> For example, the expression 7 - 4 = 3 can be read as "seven minus four equals three," "seven take away four leaves three," or "four from seven leaves three."  If the minuend is less than the subtrahend, the difference will be a [[negative number]]. For example, 17 - 25 = -8 . This can be read as "Seventeen minus twenty-five equals negative eight."
