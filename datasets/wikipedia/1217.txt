Usually, one of the ingredients is a can of soup. Many people like to [[cook]] casserole because it is a very [[simple]] [[meal]]. It is a simple way to cook a nutritional meal.   Casseroles are usually cooked slowly in the oven, sometimes covered, but often uncovered. They may be served as a main course or a side dish, and may be served in the vessel in which they were cooked. Types of casserole include [[ragout]], [[hotpot]], [[cassoulet]], [[tajine]], [[moussaka]], [[lasagne]], [[shepherd's pie]], [[gratin]], rice or macaroni [[timballo]], and [[carbonnade]].  A popular type of casserole is [[green bean casserole]], which has green beans, milk or cream, and fried onions. It was first cooked in [[Berlin, New Hampshire]] in 1866 by  Elmire Jolicoeur.  The second illustration proves how old the idea is. That casserole dish has a lid, and a spout for steam to escape. The heat is applied from below as it is with a [[stew]].   {{food-stub}}   [[Category:Baked foods]]</text>
