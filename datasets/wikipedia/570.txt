Zebras are African [[horse]]s. They are in the same [[genus]] as the common horse, ''[[Equus caballus]]'', and [[donkey]]s. Zebras are known for having many black and white stripes. There are three main [[species]] of zebra, Grevy's Zebra, the Plains Zebra, and the Mountain Zebra.  == Species == * Genus ''Equus'' ** Grevy's Zebra (''Equus grevyi'') ** Plains Zebra (''Equus quagga'')<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/41013/0 |title=Equus quagga (Plains Zebra, Burchell's Zebra, Common Zebra, Painted Zebra) |first= |last= |work=iucnredlist.org |year=2011  |quote=E. q. quagga (Quagga)  |accessdate=20 August 2011}}</ref> ***Crawshays Zebra (''Equus quagga crawshaii'') ***[[Selous' Zebra]] (''Equus quagga borensis'') ***Grants Zebra or Boehm's Zebra, (''Equus quagga boehmi'')  ***Chapman's Zebra (''Equus quagga chapmani'')  ***Burchell's Zebra (''Equus quagga burchellii'') ***[[Quagga]] (''Equus quagga quagga'')   ** Mountain Zebra (''Equus zebra'')  ==Appearance== All zebras have very short [[fur]] because they live in hot areas. Their fur has black and white stripes. The main part of the body has mostly [[vertical]] stripes, and the legs have [[horizontal]] stripes. They also have a dark line directly down their spine. Each of the different zebra species has different type of stripes. Each zebra has a unique pattern.<ref>McClintock, Dorcas 1976. ''A natural history of Zebras''. New York: Scribner's. ISBN 0-684-14621-5</ref>  Despite many attempts, we do not really know what the advantage is of having those characteristic stripes. There are different [[species]] and [[sub-species]] of zebra, and they all have stripes so, think scientists, it must be important.<ref>Larison, Brenda; Harrigan, Ryan J.; Thomassen, Henri A.; Rubenstein, Daniel I.; Chan-Golston, Alec M.; Li, Elizabeth; Smith, Thomas B.  2015.

Zebras mainly eat grass, but they also eat fruit, leaves and some vegetables. They always live near water and are an endangered species.   Zebras live in [[Africa]], south of the [[Sahara]] desert.  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{commonscat|Zebras}}  [[Category:Zebras| ]]</text>
