The year length of Venus is 225 Earth days. The day length of Venus is 243 Earth days. It is a ''[[terrestrial planet]]'' because it has a solid, [[Rock (geology)|rocky]] surface like other planets in the inner solar system. Astronomers have known Venus for thousands of years. The [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] named it after their [[god]]dess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. Venus is the brightest thing in the night sky except for [[the Moon]]. It is sometimes called the ''morning star'' or the ''evening star'' as at some [[elongation]]s it is easily seen just before the sun comes up in the morning and, at other times, just after the sun goes down in the evening. Venus comes closer to the [[Earth]] than any other planet does. A Venusian day takes about 243 Earth days.  Venus is sometimes called the [[sister]] planet of Earth as they are quite similar in size and [[gravity]]. In other ways the planets are very different. Venus' [[atmosphere]] (air) is mostly [[carbon dioxide]] with clouds of [[sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/venus/atmosphere.html|title=The Atmosphere of Venus|access-date=2008-08-19|archive-date=2009-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302062611/http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/venus/atmosphere.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> Sulphuric acid is a [[chemical]] that is very [[poison]]ous to [[human]]s.  The thick atmosphere has made it hard to see the surface, and until the twenty-first century many people thought things might [[life|live]] there. The [[pressure]] on Venus' surface is 92 times that of Earth. Venus has no [[Satellite (natural)|moons]].  Venus spins very slowly on its axis and it spins in the [[Retrograde and direct motion|opposite direction]] to the other planets.  == Physical properties == [[File:Venus globe.jpg|thumb|[[Radar]] view of the surface of Venus ([[Magellan spacecraft]])]]  Venus is a terrestrial planet so, like the Earth, its surface is made of rock. Venus is much hotter than Earth. All the [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere acts like a [[blanket]], trapping heat from the Sun. This effect is called the [[greenhouse effect]] and it is very strong on Venus. This makes the surface of Venus the hottest of any planet's surface in the Solar System with an [[estimate]]d [[average]] [[temperature]] of {{convert|480|C|F|1}}.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://filer.case.edu/sjr16/advanced/venus.html|title=Venus - an overview|access-date=2008-08-20|archive-date=2009-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911091043/http://filer.case.edu/sjr16/advanced/venus.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/GeorgeRyabov.shtml|title=Temperature on the Surface of Venus}}</ref> This is hot enough to [[melting|melt]] [[lead]] or [[zinc]].  === Geography === Venus has no oceans because it is much too hot for water. Venus' surface is a dry desert. Because of the clouds, only [[radar]] can map the surface. It is about 80% smooth, [[Rock (geology)|rocky]] [[plain]]s, made mostly of [[basalt]]. Two higher areas called [[continent]]s make up the north and south of the planet. The north is called ''Ishtar Terra'' and the south is called ''Aphrodite Terra''. They are named after the [[Babylon]]ian and [[Greek god]]desses of love.<ref>Batson R.M. & Russell J.F. 1991. ''Naming the newly found landforms on Venus''.

Because the atmosphere is so thick or dense the [[pressure]] is very high. The pressure is 92 times the pressure on Earth, enough to crush many things.  It is impossible to see the planet's surface from [[Outer space|space]] as the thick [[cloud]] layer [[reflection|reflects]] 60% of the light that hits it. The only way scientists are able to see it is by using [[infrared]] and [[UV|ultraviolet]] [[camera]]s and [[radar]].  Scientists believe that billions of years ago, the atmosphere of Venus could have been like Earth's atmosphere. There may have been lots of water on the surface of Venus. But after 600 million to several billion years, a [[greenhouse effect]] was caused by the [[evaporation]] of the water, which made lots of [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gases]] in its atmosphere.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kasting|first=James F.|date=1988|title=Runaway and moist greenhouse atmospheres and the evolution of Earth and Venus|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0019103588901169|journal=Icarus|language=en|volume=74|issue=3|pages=472494|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(88)90116-9|via=}}</ref>  ===Magnetic field=== In 1967, [[Venera 4]] found that the magnetic field of Venus was much weaker than that of Earth. This magnetic field is induced by an [[interaction]] between the [[ionosphere]] and the [[solar wind]].

Venus looks like a black dot when seen through a special telescope. These passages are called "transits". These "transits" happen in pairs eight years apart. Then it is more than a hundred years to the next pair.  ==Orbit and rotation== {{Main|Orbit of Venus}} [[File:Venusorbitsolarsystem.gif|thumb|right|Orbit of Venus compared to the orbit of the Earth]]Venus orbits the Sun at an average [[distance]] of about 108 million km (67 million mi).
