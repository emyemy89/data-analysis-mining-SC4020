<title>Mass</title><text>{{otheruses}} The '''mass''' of an object is a [[measure]] of the amount of matter in a body.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tsokos |first1=K.

Mass should not be confused with the related but quite different concept of [[weight]]. A large mass like the Earth will attract a small mass like a human being with enough force to keep the human being from floating away. "Mass attraction" is another word for [[gravity]], a force that exists between all matter.  == Units of mass == The unit of mass in the [[International System of Units]] is the [[kilogram]], which is represented by the symbol 'kg'. Fractions and multiples of this basic unit include the gram (one thousandth of a kg, symbol 'g') and the [[ton]]ne (one thousand kg), amongst many others.  In some fields or applications, it is convenient to use different units to simplify the discussions or writings. For instance, * Atomic [[physicist]]s deal with the tiny masses of individual [[atom]]s and measure them in [[atomic mass unit]]s. * Jewelers normally work with small [[jewel]]s and precious stones where masses are traditionally measured in [[Carat (mass)|carats]], which correspond to 200&nbsp;mg or 0.2 g. * The masses of stars are very large and are sometimes expressed in units of [[solar mass]]es.  Traditional units are still in encountered in some countries: [[imperial unit]]s such as the [[ounce]] or the [[Pound (mass)|pound]] were in widespread use within the British Empire. Some of them are still popular in the United States, which also uses units like the short [[ton]] (2,000 pounds, 907 kg) and the long ton (2,240 pounds), not to be confused with the metric tonne (1,000&nbsp;kg).  == Conservation of mass and relativity == {{Main|Conservation of mass}} Mass is an intrinsic property of the object: it does not depend on its volume, or position in space, for instance. For a long time (at least since the works of [[Antoine Lavoisier]] in the second half of the eighteen century), it has been known that the sum of the masses of objects that interact or of the [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] that react remain conserved throughout these processes. This remains an excellent approximation for everyday life and even most laboratory work.  However, Einstein has shown through his [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]] that the mass ''m'' of an object moving at speed ''v'' with respect to an observer must be higher than the mass of the same object observed at rest ''m<sub>0</sub>'' with respect to the observer. The applicable formula is  <math>m=\frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}}</math>  where ''c'' stands for the [[speed of light]]. This change in mass is only important when the speed of the object with respect to the observer becomes a large fraction of ''c''.  ==References== <references />  == Related pages== * [[Mass versus weight]] * [[Center of mass]] * [[Gravity]] * [[Density]] * [[Body mass index]] * Advanced topics: ** [[Standard Model]]  ** [[Higgs field]].
