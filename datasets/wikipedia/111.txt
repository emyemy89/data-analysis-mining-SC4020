<title>Circle</title><text>[[File:Circle - black simple.svg|thumb|A circle]]  A '''circle''' is a [[round]], [[2D|two-dimensional]] shape.  All [[point (geometry)|point]]s on the edge of the circle are at the same [[distance]] from the center.   The [[radius]] of a circle is a line from the centre of the circle to a point on the side.  Mathematicians use the letter ''r'' for the length of a circle's radius.  The [[wikt:centre|centre]] of a circle is the point in the very middle. It is sometimes written as <math>O</math>.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2020-04-17|title=List of Geometry and Trigonometry Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/geometry-trigonometry-symbols/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-24|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}}</ref>  The [[diameter]] (meaning "all the way across") of a circle is a straight line that goes from one side to the opposite and right through the centre of the circle.  Mathematicians use the letter ''d'' for the length of this line.  The diameter of a circle is equal to twice its radius (''d'' equals 2 times ''r''):<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Circle|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Circle.html|access-date=2020-09-24|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}}</ref>  :<math> d = 2\ r  </math>  The [[circumference]] (meaning "all the way around") of a circle is the line that goes around the centre of the circle.

It is the length of the circumference divided by the length of the diameter ('''' equals ''C'' divided by ''d''). As a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] the number  is equal to about {{frac|22|7}}  or 335/113 (which is closer) and as a number it is about 3.1415926535.  {| |- |||<math>\pi = \frac{C}{d}</math> |- |<math>\therefore</math>||<math>C = 2\pi \, r</math> |} [[File:Circle_Area.svg|thumb|The area of the circle is equal to  times the area of the gray square.]] The [[area]], ''A'', inside a circle is equal to the radius multiplied by itself, then multiplied by  (''A'' equals  times ''r'' times ''r'').  :<math>A = \pi \, r^2 </math>  ==Calculating == '''''' can be measured by drawing a large circle, then measuring its diameter (''d'') and circumference (''C'').

Most methods used for calculating the value of  have desirable mathematical properties. However, they are hard to understand without knowing [[trigonometry]] and [[calculus]].  However, some methods are quite simple, such as this form of the [[Gottfried Leibniz|Gregory-Leibniz]] [[series]]:  :<math> \pi = \frac{4}{1}-\frac{4}{3}+\frac{4}{5}-\frac{4}{7}+\frac{4}{9}-\frac{4}{11}\cdots </math>.  While that series is easy to write and calculate, it is not easy to see why it equals .  A much easier way to approach is to draw an imaginary circle of radius '''r''' centered at the origin.  Then any point (''x'',''y'') whose distance '''d''' from the origin is less than '''r''', calculated by the [[Pythagorean theorem]], will be inside the circle:  :<math> d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}</math>  Finding a set of points inside the circle allows the circle's area '''A''' to be estimated, for example, by using integer coordinates for a big '''r'''. Since the area '''A''' of a circle is  times the radius squared,  can be approximated by using the following formula:  :<math> \pi = \frac{A}{r^2} </math>  ==Related pages== * [[Semicircle]] * [[Sphere]] * [[Squaring the circle]] * [[Tau]]  == References == <references />  == Other websites == {{commons|Circle}} * [http://www.mathepower.com/english/kreis.php Calculate the measures of a circle online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035947/http://www.mathepower.com/english/kreis.php |date=2007-09-28 }}  [[Category:Shapes]] [[Category:Conic sections]]</text>
