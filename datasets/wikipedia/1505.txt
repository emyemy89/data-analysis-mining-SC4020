It is the 22nd largest US state by [[total area]] with 65,757.70 sq mi (170,312 km<sup>2</sup>) and the third most-populous with a 2015 [[population]] of more than 21 million. It is a [[peninsula]], which means that water surrounds the state on three of four possible sides. To the west is the [[Gulf of Mexico]], to the south is the [[Florida Straits]], and to the east is the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The highest elevation in Florida is [[Britton Hill]].   ==History== {{main|History of Florida}}  Florida had many residents from many tribes and nations living in almost all parts of it for thousands of years. These include the Timucua, the Tequesta, the Calusa, the Seminole, the Miccosukee, and many more. Florida was first discovered by a European in 1513 by the Spanish [[Juan Ponce de Len|Ponce De Leon]], who called this peninsula "Tierra de la Pascua Florida" (Land of the Easter flowered) because it was discovered on [[Easter]]: in the next centuries only the last word remained.<ref>[https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/ponce-de-len-lands-florida Ponce De Leon life]</ref>  Northern Florida contains [[hill]]s because it is at the very end of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The highest hill in Florida is Britton Hill, in northern [[Walton County]] near the town of [[Lakewood, Florida]]. It is {{convert|345|ft}} above [[sea level]]. It is the shortest of the highest points in all other states.<ref name="Britton">{{cite web |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/UW268 |title=The Florida Environment: An Overview |date=July 2007 |last=Main |first=Martin B. |last2=Allen |first2=Ginger M. |publisher=[[University of Florida]], [[Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences]] |accessdate=2008-01-23 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uNhCpOjH?url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/uw268 |archivedate=2010-11-20 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Florida has the longest [[coastline]] in the continental United States.The [[Gulf Stream]] [[ocean current]] goes through the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near the east coast of Florida, so the water is warmer than the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The [[Gulf of Mexico]] is on the west coast of Florida.  In the center of southern Florida is a [[lake]] called [[Lake Okeechobee]]. It is the seventh largest [[freshwater]] lake in the United States <ref>Muller, Peter O. "Lake Okeechobee."

A lot of south Florida used to be covered by a [[swamp]] called the [[Everglades]]. When Florida was first being settled, [[farmer]]s found out the [[soil]] there was fertile, so they drained some of the wetlands in 1882 for farming. In 1947, the state constructed [[levee]]s and [[canal]]s to make more room for farming and houses. The Everglades is now about half the size it used to be.<ref>{{cite web | last = U.S. Geological Survey | title = Florida Everglades | work = Circular 1182 | publisher = U.S. Geological Survey | year = 1999 | url = http://sofia.usgs.gov/publications/circular/1182/ | accessdate = 2008-03-14 | archive-date = 2008-06-26 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626081529/http://sofia.usgs.gov/publications/circular/1182/ | url-status = dead }}</ref> Most of what is left is now the [[Everglades National Park]]. Lots of animals live there, including [[alligator]]s and [[puma|Florida panther]]s. Recently, Florida has been trying to restore the Everglades.  At the southernmost tip of Florida is a chain of [[island]]s called the [[Florida Keys]]. There are 4500 islands in the Keys. The most famous one is [[Key West]].  == Weather == [[File:BahiaHonda.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Bahia Honda beach in south Florida.]][[File:Jacksonville Snow 2.jpg|thumb|[[Snow]] is very uncommon in Florida, but has fallen in every major Florida city at least once. Snow does fall sometimes in North Florida.]] Florida is nicknamed the Sunshine State. During the summer, temperatures may rise up to as high as 109 degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (or 40.5 degrees [[Celsius]]). Its annual average temperature is much warmer than many of the other states, but during winter, temperatures occasionally fall below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. In Florida, a dozen [[palm tree]] species are native to the state. Florida has both a rainy season and dry season. Southern Florida does not have four separate seasons.<ref>{{cite book| last = Stewart| first = Melissa| title = Life in a Wetland| url = https://books.google.com/?id=_WbzyhcWLHoC&pg=PA11| year = 2003| publisher = Twenty-First Century Books| isbn = 978-0-8225-4687-0| page = 11 }}</ref>  Florida's sunny climate attracts visitors. The summer is great for [[surfing]] the waves and enjoying the beaches. The most popular sport in Florida is [[fishing]].  Florida is vulnerable to [[hurricane]]s due to its proximity to the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane season is from June 1 to November 30, but sometimes a hurricane will occur outside of this period. [[Hurricane Andrew]] was a destructive hurricane that hit Florida on August 23, 1992. Florida's most active recorded hurricane seasons were in [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season|2004]] and [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]], when it was hit by hurricanes [[Hurricane Charley|Charley]] (August 13), [[Hurricane Frances|Frances]] (September 45), [[Hurricane Ivan|Ivan]] (September 16), [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]] (September 25), [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] (August 25), and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] (October 24).  == Animals == [[File:Florida Scrub Jay.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Florida Scrub Jay]] is found only in Florida.]] Florida has many types of [[wildlife]] including: * [[Marine Mammal]]s: [[Bottlenose Dolphin]], [[Pilot Whale|Short-finned Pilot Whale]], [[Right Whale|North Atlantic Right Whale]], [[Manatee|West Indian Manatee]] * [[Reptile]]s: [[American Alligator]] and [[American Crocodile|Crocodile]], [[Crotalus adamanteus|Eastern Diamondback]] and [[Sistrurus miliarius barbouri|Pygmy]] [[Rattlesnake]]s, [[Gopherus polyphemus|Gopher Tortoise]], [[Green turtle|Green]] and [[Leatherback Sea Turtle]]s, [[Eastern indigo snake]] * [[Mammal]]s: [[Florida panther]], [[Otter|Northern River Otter]], [[Mink]], [[Rabbit|Eastern Cottontail Rabbit]], [[Marsh Rabbit]], [[Raccoon]], [[Skunk|Striped Skunk]], [[Squirrel]], [[White-tailed deer]], [[Key Deer]], [[Bobcat]]s, [[Gray Fox]], [[Coyote]], [[Wild Boar]], [[Florida Black Bear]], [[Armadillo|Nine-banded Armadillo]]s * [[Bird]]s: [[Bald Eagle]], [[Northern Caracara]], [[Snail Kite]], [[Osprey]], [[American White Pelican|White]] and [[Brown Pelican]]s, [[Sea Gulls]], [[Whooping Crane|Whooping]] and [[Sandhill Crane]]s, [[Roseate Spoonbill]], [[Florida Scrub Jay]] (state [[endemism|endemic]]), and others.
