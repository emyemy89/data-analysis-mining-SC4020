When a person makes the same trip every day to work or school, this type of travelling is usually called "commuting."  Some people travel to other cities as part of their job.  This is called "business travel." When many people travel to a distant place to stay, it is called "[[human migration]]".   Some people travel on their vacation, to visit other towns, cities, or countries.  This is [[tourism]].  These people stay overnight in hotels, hostels, motels, apartments or [[bed and breakfast]].  Some prefer [[camping]].  Through the centuries, '''modes of travel''' have changed.  Some people (travel writers) write about travelling in books including [[autobiography|autobiographies]] or [[journal]]s.
