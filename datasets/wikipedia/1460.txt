<title>Arm</title><text>[[File:Arm.agr.jpg|thumb|An arm.]] An '''arm''' is a [[limb]]. Most [[human]]s have two arms each, coming out of their [[body]] just below the [[Neck (body part)|neck]]. On the end of each arm is a [[hand]]. Humans use arms and hands to do things to other objects, this is called [[manipulation]]. The main purpose of the hand is to grasp objects. Some other [[primate]]s have arms which they use to move around by holding onto [[tree]]s or supporting themselves as they walk along the [[ground]].  ==Related pages== *[[Leg]] *[[Trapezius muscle]]  {{Commonscat|Arms|Arm}}   {{Biology-stub}}  [[Category:Limbs and extremities]] [[Category:Basic English 850 words]]  <!-- interwiki --></text>
