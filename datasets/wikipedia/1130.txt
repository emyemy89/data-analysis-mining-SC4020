It is spoken in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Luxembourg]]; natively by around 100 million people. It is the most widely spoken [[mother tongue]] in the [[first language]]. There are some people who speak German in [[Belgium]] and in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[France]] and Northern [[Italy]]. There are people who speak German in many countries, including the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], where many people emigrated from Germany. It also spoken in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], and [[Russia]].  German is a part of the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] [[language family]] and is much like [[English language|English]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Much of the [[vocabulary]] in German is related to English, but the [[grammar]] is more complicated.  German has a system of [[case (grammar)|cases]], and when helping verbs are used, the main part of the verb must be moved to the end of the sentence. For example, "Someone has stolen my car" is ''Jemand hat mein Auto gestohlen'' ("Someone has my car stolen"), and "Someone called me last night" is ''Jemand hat mich letzte Nacht angerufen'' ("Someone has me last night called").  In writing, every [[noun]] must start with a [[capital letter]]. German is the only language that still has that rule, but Danish and English did so a long time ago.  Standard German is an official language in Switzerland, but the Swiss dialect of German is difficult to understand for native speakers from Germany and even for Swiss who are not native to speaking German. One reason that the dialects are still so different today is that even if Switzerland adopted Standard German, mostly as a written standard, German Swiss in [[World War II]] wanted to separate themselves from the [[Nazis]] by choosing to speak dialect over the Standard German.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p8GgX_hWyA|title = Languages of Switzerland|first = |last = |website = YouTube|publisher = |accessdate = }}</ref>  [[Swiss German]] also has some differences in [[orthography|spelling]], for example, the letter ''[[]]'', which is used only in German, is replaced by ''ss''.  == Dialects == * [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]] * [[Austro-Bavarian language|Bavarian dialect]] * [[Franconian Dialect]] * [[Klsch language|Klsch]] * [[Low Saxon]] * [[Swiss German|Swiss dialect]] * Mannheimerisch dialect * [[Palatinate German]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  '''Notes''' {{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}  == Other websites == {{InterWiki|code=de}} *[http://www.Deutsched.com Online German Language Course] An online German language course that includes lessons covering pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. *[http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/German_phrasebook German phrasebook at Wikivoyage] *[http://www.learntospeakgerman.net Learn to Speak German] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608044636/http://learntospeakgerman.net/ |date=2013-06-08 }} Student Resource *[http://www.populearn.com/german/ Free German Language Course] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217004814/http://www.populearn.com/german/ |date=2013-02-17 }} *[http://www.visuellesynonyme.com/ German Thesaurus]  {{Germanic languages}}  [[Category:German language| ]]</text>
