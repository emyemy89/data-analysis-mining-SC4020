It is one of the richest and most highly developed parts of China. Hong Kong grew quickly in the decades after [[World War II]]. It is now a famous world class financial center. Hong Kong was one of the last territories of the [[British Empire]] before China obtained it and granted it special status in 1997.  The population of Hong Kong is more than seven million. The economy has rapidly grown from a trading port to a very rich city. Hong Kong also has the world's largest number of skyscrapers.  Hong Kong is divided into 3 main parts: * [[Hong Kong Island]] * [[Kowloon]] * [[New Territories]] (including 235 outlying [[island]]s)  Hong Kong was a British colony from 1842 to 1997 because China lost the [[Second Opium War]]. After the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|handover]], Hong Kong became under Chinese control  but with a lot of autonomy.  Hong Kong has its own [[constitution]] that is different from that of the People's Republic of China (PRC).  == Climate == Hong Kong is in a tropical area, and has [[monsoon]] winds. It is cool and wet in [[winter]] (Jan-Mar), hot and rainy from [[spring]] through [[summer]] (Apr-Sep), and warm, sunny and dry in the [[autumn]] (Oct-Dec). The rainy [[season]] is from May until September. In summer and early autumn, there is a frequent threat of [[typhoons]]. As Hong Kong is located nearly at the centre of the [[Eurasian Plate]], there are sometimes tsunamis and earthquakes.  == Population and language == The population of Hong Kong reached 7 million (7,496,98) in 2020. Most of the people in Hong Kong are [[China|Chinese]]. Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. It has an overall density of 6,300 people per square kilometre.  Hong Kong has one of the worlds lowest birth rates1.11 per woman at an age of being capable to give birth as of 2012. This is far below the rate needed to replace each person, 2.1.  People from Hong Kong mainly speak [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]. Students are required to learn [[English language|English]] at school. Ever since Hong Kong became a part of China, the number of people who speak [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]] has increased because Mandarin is the official language of the PRC.  == Public holidays == 17 days of the year are [[public holiday]]s in Hong Kong: * 1 January - [[New Year's Day]], the beginning of the year * the [[Chinese New Year]] - 15 [[days]] of celebrations, of which 3 are public holidays * [[Ching Ming Festival|Qingming Festival]], also known as "Tomb Sweeping Day" * [[Easter]] (3 public holidays) * 1 May - [[Labour Day]] * [[Vesak|The Buddha's birthday]] * [[Dragon Boat Festival]] * 1 July (HKSAR Day) * the day ''after'' [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] * 1 Oct - [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|Chinese National Day]] * [[Chung Yeung Festival|Chongyang Festival]] - a day when people honor their ancestors, similar to "Tomb Sweeping Day" * 25 December - [[Christmas]] * 26 December - [[Boxing Day]] * 31 December - [[New Year's Eve]], or the last day of the year  == Currency == There are [[coin]]s from 10 cents to 10 Hong Kong Dollars; and bank-notes (paper money bills) from $10 to $1000. One American [[dollar]] is equal to about $7.75 in Hong Kong Dollars, at the official [[bank]] exchange rate.  == Public transport == * [[MTR|Mass Transit Railway]] (MTR) which was established in 1979, owns seven lines (10 lines after KCR merger), ** Kwun Tong Line (running between Whampoa/Ho Man Tin and Tiu Keng Leng) ** Tsuen Wan Line (running between Tsuen Wan and Central) ** Island Line (running between Kennedy Town and Chai Wan) ** South Island Line (running between Admiralty and South Horizons) ** Tseung Kwan O Line (running between Po Lam/LOHAS Park and North Point) ** Tung Chung Line (running between Tung Chung/Tsing Yi and Hong Kong) ** Airport Express (running between AsiaWorld-Expo and Hong Kong) ** Disneyland Resort Line (running between Sunny Bay and Disneyland Resort) ** East Rail Line (running between Hung Hom and Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau) ** West Rail Line (running between Hung Hom and Tuen Mun/Kam Sheung Road) ** Tuen Ma Line Phase I(Ma On Shan Line)(running between Wu Kai Sha and Kai Tak) * Bus: there are four major bus companies in Hong Kong, such as KMB which mainly services [[Kowloon]], the rest are [[New Lantau Bus]], who mainly services [[Lantau Island]], [[Citybus]], which mainly serves [[Hong Kong International Airport|airpor]]<nowiki/>t routes and [[New World First Bus]], which mainly services [[Hong Kong Island]]. * Public Light Bus: in the 1960s, it was an [[illegal]] [[transportation]], but later on, the [[government]] noticed that if there were only buses in Hong Kong, then some [[villages]] in N.T. will not have a [[public transport]]. Therefore, the [[Legislative Council]] made it legal and under government control. * Tram (running between Kennedy Town, Happy Valley, and Shau Kei Wan) * [[Peak Tram]] (running between Garden Road and Victoria Peak) * Taxi (Red, Green, and Blue) * Ferry (Lots of different companies, including the [[Star Ferry]], First Ferry and Fortune Ferry companies) * [[Hong Kong International Airport]] is the main airport of the territory. It is the [[List of busiest airports in the world|busiest airport in the world]] in [[Cargo|cargo traffic]] terms.  ==Education== Hong Kong's education system is mostly based off the [[Education in Engl|English]] system. Children are required to be in school from age 6 until completing [[secondary school]] (high school) at age 18.  ===Universities=== Hong Kong has 11 Universities: *[[University of Hong Kong]] *[[Chinese University of Hong Kong]]  *[[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]]  *[[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]] *[[City University of Hong Kong]] *[[Hong Kong Baptist University]] *[[Education University of Hong Kong]]  *[[Open University of Hong Kong]] *[[Lingnan University]] *[[Hong Kong Shue Yan University]] *[[Hang Seng University of Hong Kong]]  ==Housing in Hong Kong== According to the International Housing Affordability survey, Hong Kong has the most [[affordable housing|unaffordable housing market]] in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortunebuilders.com/worlds-unaffordable-housing-markets-34656/|title=The Worlds Most Unaffordable Housing Markets|date=2014-01-24|website=FortuneBuilders|access-date=2020-06-24}}</ref>It has been ranked as most unaffordable since 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-21/hong-kong-housing-ranked-world-s-least-affordable-for-9th-year|title=Hong Kong Housing Is World's Least Affordable for 9th Year|last=Kwan|first=Shawna|date=21 January 2019|website=[[Bloomberg News]]|access-date=21 June 2020}}</ref>  == Timeline of Hong Kong == Here is a brief history of Hong Kong: [[File:Rocks at old age.JPG|thumb|Some very old rocks found in Hong Kong]]  '''Around 4000 BC''' * Sea levels rose above 100&nbsp;meters '''Around 3500 BC''' * Ceramic forms decorated with a wide range of patterns '''Around 2000 BC''' * Bronze weapons, knives, arrowheads & tools. * Metal worked locally '''Around 500 BC''' * Ancient Chinese writing developed '''221 BC''' * People from [[Mainland China]] came to Hong Kong '''220 BC''' * Coins from the Chinese Han period were used in Hong Kong '''1555''' * A Portuguese named Jorge lvares was the first European to reach Hong Kong '''1799''' * China banned the drug trade in Hong Kong '''1800''' * Opium became a huge business [[File:Opium.jpg|thumb|Opium flower]] '''1839''' * Lin Zexu was appointed Special Commissioner * The First Opium war began '''1841''' * Hong Kong was given to the British and became a [[British Hong Kong|dependent territory of United Kingdom]] * Lord Palmerston wrote that Hong Kong was a barren island with only a few houses on it ''' January 26, 1841''' * The British flag was raised at Possession Point, on Hong Kong Island '''August 1841''' * Sir Henry Pottinger became Hong Kong's first governor * The Treaty of Nanjing was signed, ending the First Opium War '''1860''' * China was defeated in the Second Opium War.
