An aircraft is a [[machine]] that can [[Flight|fly]], but is heavier than [[air]]. Fixed-wing aircraft are sometimes called airplanes, aeroplanes or sometimes just "planes". All fixed-wing aircraft have [[wing]]s that use [[Movement|forward airspeed]] to generate [[lift (force)|lift]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aviation-history.com/theory/lift.htm |title=How Airplanes Fly: A Physical Description of Lift |author=David Anderson; Scott Eberhardt |website= |publisher=The Aviation History Online Museum |accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref> [[Glider]]s are fixed-wing aircraft that do not have [[engine]]s.<ref>Susan Meredith, ''How Do Aircraft Fly?''

It could fly by itself without needing to be dropped from high up. There were [[glider|gliders]] before this, but they had to fly by being pushed off a building or hill.  The first man who flew (took off, steered, and landed) a motor-powered aircraft was [[Orville Wright]] in 1903 in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, [[USA]].<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11372/ |title = Telegram from Orville Wright in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, to His Father Announcing Four Successful Flights, 1903 December 17 |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1903-12-17 |accessdate = 2013-07-21 }}</ref>  == Modern day == Today, fixed-wing aircraft fly between many cities all over the world, carrying people and [[cargo]].  Big cities usually have an [[international]] [[airport]], where large fixed-wing aircraft can land and take off safely.  Some large cities like [[New York City]] and [[London]] have more than one airport.  Two major makers of fixed-wing aircraft are [[Airbus]] and [[Boeing]].  Advances in technology have made fixed-wing aircraft more efficient.  Things like [[winglet]]s and more efficient [[turbofan]]s have helped to do this.  == Parts == Most fixed-wing aircraft have certain parts in common.  * The '''wings''' are the most important part because they are what makes the plane fly. The [[wing]]s create a [[Force (physics)|force]] called lift that goes against gravity which makes the plane get off the ground. When air flows around the wing (which happens when the plane moves forward) the wing pushes air down, which in turn pushes the plane up. Lift can also be explained using [[Bernoulli's principle]]; since wings are designed so that air goes faster on the top of the wing than on the bottom, the higher pressure on the bottom will push the plane up.  Some wings have panels on the back called flaps. Flaps can be extended to make the wing bigger. This makes the wing make more lift, but also more [[Drag (physics)|drag]]. This lets the plane fly slower without [[stall]]ing, so flaps are often used during takeoff and landing. * The '''tail''' (also called the [[vertical stabilizer]]) is a large flat panel normally at the back of the plane. This helps the plane fly straight. Some planes have more than one tail, like the [[Antonov An-225]]. Some planes also have no tail, like the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit]]. * '''Engines''' push the plane forward.  This makes air flow over the wings, which makes the plane fly.  Some planes have [[propeller]]s that the [[engine]] turns.  Others have [[jet engine]]s.  Some fixed-wing aircraft, such as [[glider]]s, don't have engines. Instead they use gravity to give them forward speed. * The '''fuselage''' is the part of the plane that holds the people and [[cargo]].  It is normally shaped like a [[cylinder]]. The [[fuselage]] might have windows or doors. * The '''landing gear''' or [[undercarriage]] is what supports the plane on the ground. It can be wheels if the plane lands on the ground, or [[float (nautical)|float]]s if the plane lands in the water. If the plane lands in snow, the landing gear usually has [[wikt:ski|ski]]s. Many planes can retract (bring inside the fuselage) their landing gear to make less [[Drag (physics)|drag]].  == Uses == === Transportation === Fixed-wing aircraft have long been used as [[airliner]]<nowiki/>s for moving [[passenger]]<nowiki/>s from place to place.  [[Cargo aircraft]] carry [[cargo]] across seas and long distances, and passenger aircraft also carry some cargo.  === Uses in War === [[File:Su-27 low pass.jpg|thumb|''Russian Knights'' in a low pass, [[Moscow]].]] The first aircraft for war bombing was used in [[Libya]] in 1911 by [[Italy]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Some fixed-wing aircraft are used by [[air force]]s to [[defense (military)|defend]] countries.  These may be [[fighter aircraft]], using [[machine gun|guns]] or [[missile]]s for combat with other aircraft.  They may be [[bomber]]s, dropping [[bomb]]s on ground targets.  Fixed-wing aircraft allow people to travel longer distances, and faster than [[ship]]s or [[railway|trains]]. Aircraft can fly from New York to London in about 7 hours. It would take one week or more on a ship. Militaries use airplanes to carry their soldiers quickly from place to place.  Airplanes are also used by the military to see many things on the ground easily. This is called [[surveillance]] or [[reconnaissance]].  Often, fixed-wing aircraft will take [[photograph]]s as well, which can be used for military planning later.  == Safety == [[Statistics]] show that riding in a plane is safer than driving in a car.<ref name="ur.umich.edu">[http://ur.umich.edu/0203/Jan20_03/18.shtml Flying still safer than driving, even in wake of Sept. 11]</ref>  ==Image gallery== <gallery widths="px" heights="px"> File:80 Blue Sukhoi Su-17 UM-3 Russian Airforce (7724104334).jpg|Military airplanes in [[Russia]] File:Edw-nasa-747-041103-01.jpg|An airplane used for research by [[NASA]] File:An Aerial Fight Art.IWMART654.jpg|Early airplanes in a battle in [[France]] File:Cessna 208B Grand Caravan AN1189964.jpg|A private airplane </gallery>  == References == {{commonscat|Fixed-wing aircraft}} {{reflist}}  {{aircraft}}  [[Category:Aircraft]] [[Category:Aerospace engineering]]</text>
