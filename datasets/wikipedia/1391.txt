They are a way of asexual reproduction]]  '''Sex''' is a type of [[reproduction]] common among living things. Sex is used by [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, and also by [[fungi]] and various single-celled organisms. It usually needs two individuals which are different sexes from the same [[species]]. It works by combining [[gene]]s from more than one source.<ref>King R.C. Stansfield W.D. & Mulligan P.K. 2006. ''A dictionary of genetics'', 7th ed. Oxford.</ref>  == Biological type == Organisms may have more than one kind of reproduction: # [[Asexual reproduction]]: an example is the binary fission of an [[amoeba]]. Sometimes [[jellyfish]], and many [[insect]]s split or produce eggs without fertilisation. These are all methods of asexual reproduction. # [[Sexual reproduction]]: most plants and animals reproduce by a union of two different sexes. Each sex makes the special cells used for reproduction. The new organism is made when both types of cells are united in a fertilised egg or [[zygote]]. Organisms that can make both kinds of cells for reproduction are called [[hermaphrodite]]s. For example, most [[snail]]s are hermaphrodite.<ref>{{cite web| title=Common snail, garden snail| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/415.shtml | publisher=BBC| accessdate=2010-05-13}}</ref> #* Those organisms that produce [[sperm]] are called ''male'', those that produce [[ovum|ova]] (eggs) are called ''female''. # Some animals and plants are capable of reproducing either sexually or asexually.  == Benefits and drawbacks == Asexual reproduction is easier than sexual reproduction, but there are benefits and drawbacks to both: * An offspring produced asexually inherits [[gene]]s only from its parent. * Offspring produced sexually are genetically somewhat different from either parent. They inherit [[gene]]s from both parents.  == Humans == [[File:Anterior view of human female and male, with labels.svg|thumb|Human female and male|x223px]] In humans, sex is normally either [[male]] or [[female]]. For example: John's sex is [[male]]. Jane's sex is [[female]]. Most of the time, the sex of a person depends on what sex [[chromosome]]s that person got from his or her parents. A woman's ovum (egg cell) contains one X chromosome. A man's sperm contains either an X or a Y chromosome. When a sperm and ova combine to form a fertilised egg, the baby may get either of these chromosomes from its father. If the baby gets two X chromosomes, it will develop into a female. If the baby gets one X and one Y, it will develop into a male. Before babies are born, their sex parts are already formed, but not ready yet. During [[Puberty]], the sex parts finish developing as well as other parts of the body like [[breast]]s and [[body hair]].  There are some exceptions to this rule. Sometimes, the process of [[meiosis]], which makes the sex cells, can go differently. This can result in a person having 3 X chromosomes, or 2 Y chromosomes or XXY instead of XY. Other times, the body may not follow exactly what their chromosomes are telling it to do.  Some people may have sexual feelings that are different from their bodies. For instance, a male person may only be attracted to other males and not to females. This is called [[Homosexuality]]. There are also people, who feel they're a different sex from their bodies. These people are called [[Transgender]]. All these variations are sometimes called [[gender]].  == Evolution == Sexual reproduction first appeared about a billion years ago. It [[evolution|evolved]] within single-celled [[eukaryote]]s.<ref>{{cite web| title=Book Review for ''Life: a natural history of the first Four billion years of life on Earth''| url=http://jupiterscientific.org/review/life.html | publisher=Jupiter Scientific| accessdate=2008-04-07}}</ref> The scientific community still discusses why it appeared, and why it still exists. Reasons commonly given include: * Sex creates variation in offspring. If there are traits that give an advantage to the organism, they spread more easily. Traits that give a disadvantage tend to be removed quickly.  Sexual reproduction is a process that can only be found in [[eukaryote]]s. These cells have a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[mitochondria]]. There are other kinds of organisms (other than animals, plants and fungi), the [[protist|other eukaryotes]]  such as the [[malaria]] parasite  that also engage in sexual reproduction. Some [[bacteria]] use [[conjugation]] to transfer genetic material between bacteria.  This is not the same as sexual reproduction, but it results in a similar mixture of genetic traits.  In sexual reproduction the cells used for reproduction, called [[gamete]]s, are either eggs or sperms. Fertilisation needs two different such cells. The mechanism of cell division only works when one sperm alone enters the egg. Once it is in, a fast reaction goes through the egg cell wall to shut off all other sperm.<ref>     Amanda Schaffer, [http://www.slate.com/id/2174380/?<!--     -->GT1=10538 "Pas de Deux: why are there only two sexes?"],     ''Slate'', updated 2007-09-27. </ref><ref>     Laurence D.

In humans, males and females usually look different. In many species they do not, except for the sex organs. Sex can be determined in different ways: * [[Hermaphrodite]]s produce both male and female [[gamete]]s. This system can be found in some animals, for example [[snail]]s, and in most [[flowering plant]]s.<ref name=dellaporta_1993>{{cite journal| title=Sex Determination in Flowering Plants| author=Dellaporta SL, Calderon-Urrea A| journal=The Plant Cell| volume=5| year=1993| pages=12411251 | doi = 10.2307/3869777}}</ref> * In most cases there are separate sexes. This means that an organism either produces male gametes or eggs, but not both at the same time. The biological cause for an organism developing into one sex or the other is called [[sex determination]]. * As a result of sex determination, the organism is either male, or female.  When there is sex determination there are basically two cases: * The sex is determined through the genes the organism inherits from its parents. * The sex is determined through the environment.  === Genetic === [[File:Drosophila XY sex-determination.svg|thumb|200px|right|Like humans and other mammals, the common fruit fly has an XY sex determination system.]] Usually, sex is determined by an organism's [[gene]]s. With genetic sex determination, most [[allele]]s or genes that influence sexual development are on the same [[chromosome]]. That chromosome is then called the [[sex chromosome]]. Because genetic sex determination is controlled by a pair of sex chromosomes (or if of one of the chromosomes is there or not), there are usually the same number of male and female offspring. In humans, for instance, sperms carry either an X or a Y chromosome, and they occur in roughly equal numbers.  [[File:Ocellaris clownfish.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|200px|[[Clownfish]] are initially male; the largest fish in a group becomes female.]]  === Nongenetic === For some species sex is not determined by [[inheritance]], but instead by [[environment]]al factors experienced during development or later in life. Many [[reptile]]s have temperature-dependent sex determination: the temperature embryos experience during their development determines the sex of the organism. In some [[turtle]]s, for example, males are produced at lower incubation temperatures than females; this difference in critical temperatures can be as little as 1-2&nbsp;C.  Some [[fish]] change sex over the course of their life. This phenomenon is called ''sequential hermaphroditism''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://faculty.bennington.edu/~sherman/coral%20reef%20bio/cayman%20course%202007/cayman%20papers/sex%20changes%20fish.pdf|format=pdf|title=Diversity and flexibility of sex change strategies in animals|author=Phliip L. Munday | display-authors = etal|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|volume=21|number=1|date=February 2006}}</ref> In [[clownfish]], smaller fish are male, and the dominant and largest fish in a group becomes female. In many [[wrasse]] the opposite is truemost fish are female at birth and become male when they reach a certain size. Sequential hermaphrodites may produce both types of gametes over the course of their lifetime, but at any given point they are either female or male.  In some [[fern]]s the default sex is hermaphrodite. Ferns which grow in soil which has previously supported hermaphrodites are influenced by hormones remaining to develop as male.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sex-determining mechanisms in land plants| author=Tanurdzic M and Banks JA| journal=The Plant Cell| year=2004| volume=16| pages=S61S71|doi=10.1105/tpc.016667|pmid=15084718}}</ref>  == Related pages == *[[Asexual reproduction]] *[[The Red Queen#The evolution of sex|The evolution of sex]] *[[Gender]] *[[Nudity]] *[[Sexual intercourse]] *[[Sexual reproduction]]  == References == {{reflist|2}}  {{commonscat}}  [[Category:Sexuality| ]] [[Category:Biological reproduction]]</text>
