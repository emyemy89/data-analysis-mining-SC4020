We see many objects that are actually in space such as the Sun, the Moon, and stars because they are in the sky. On a clear day the sky appears [[blue]]. At night it appears. The deepness of the blue increases as we look toward the [[horizon]], and up to the point above us.  The sky, which is made up of gas [[molecule]]s, is blue because of the random scattering of sunlight by the molecules. [[Rayleigh scattering]] defines the amount of scattering of [[light]] rays. [[Blue]] light scatters much more than [[red]], which is why the sky appears blue on a clear day. Depending on the time of day, the sky may appear different colors. At [[Sunrise|dawn]] or [[Sunset|dusk]] the sky may appear red, orange, or even green and purple depending on how low the sun is and how close it is to night.  Other planets have skies too. Because the types of gases in their atmospheres are different, they have different sky colors. For example, the sky on [[Mars]] is red.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://marsmobile.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/|title=Mars Mobile|website=marsmobile.jpl.nasa.gov|access-date=2019-01-04}}</ref>  Many things can be seen in the sky. There are objects from space like the Sun, Moon, and stars. There are also many weather events seen in the sky. For example, these can be [[Cloud|clouds]], [[rain]], [[lightning]], or [[fog]].<ref name=":0" /> Weather is caused by different patterns and temperatures in the atmosphere. Other things that can be seen in the sky are [[Bird|birds]], other flying animals, and [[aircraft]].  == Other websites ==  * [http://www.rayching.co.nz/sky.htm Day Sky Images] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815121431/http://www.rayching.co.nz/sky.htm |date=2007-08-15 }} * [http://www.astronomy.net.nz/ Night Sky Images] * [http://www.hanifworld.com/Sky.htm Sky Photo Gallery] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430121713/http://www.hanifworld.com/Sky.htm |date=2007-04-30 }} * [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html Why is the sky blue?]  == References == {{reflist}}  {{science-stub}}  [[Category:Basic English 850 words]]</text>
