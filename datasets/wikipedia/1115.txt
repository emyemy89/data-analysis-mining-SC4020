<title>States of matter</title><text>[[File:Phase change - en.svg|thumbnail|350px|right|Common phase changes found in nature]]  There are four common '''states of matter''' (or ''phases'') in the [[universe]]: [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].   The state of matter affects a substance's properties. Examples of those properties include [[density]], [[viscosity]] (how well it flows), [[malleability]] (how easy it is to bend), and [[conduction|conductivity]]. Changes between states of matter are often [[wikt:reversible|reversible]].  == Common states of matter == === Solids === {{main|Solid}} In a ''solid'', the positions of atoms are fixed relative to each other over a long time. That is due to the [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]] or "friction" between [[molecule]]s. This cohesion is provided by [[Metallic bond|metallic]], [[Covalent bond|covalent]] or [[Ionic bond|ionic]] [[Chemical bond|bonds]]. Only solids can be pushed on by a force without changing shape, which means that they can be resistant to [[deformation]]. Solids also tend to be strong enough to hold their own shape in a container. Solids are generally denser than liquids. Solid becoming a gas is called sublimation.  === Liquids === {{main|Liquid}} In a ''liquid'', molecules are attracted to each other strongly enough to keep them in contact, but not strongly enough to hold a particular structure. The molecules can continually move with respect to each other. This means that liquids can flow smoothly, but not as smoothly as gases. Liquids will tend to take the shape of a container that they are in. Liquids are generally less dense than solids, but denser than gases.  === Gases === {{main|Gas}} In a ''gas'', the chemical bonds are not strong enough to hold atoms or molecules together, and from this a gas is a collection of independent, unbonded molecules which interact mainly by [[collision]]. Gases tend to take the shape of their container, and are less dense than both solids and liquids. Gases have weaker forces of attraction than solids and liquids. Gas becoming a solid directly is called deposition.  Gases can sometimes turn directly into solids without passing through a fluid stage. That is called [[desublimation]]. You see it in the hoary [[frost]] which forms on window-panes in cold climates. It is the reverse of [[sublimation]].  === Plasmas === {{main|Plasma (physics)}} ''Plasmas'' are gases that have so much [[Kinetic energy|energy]] that [[electron]]s of an atom cannot stay in [[orbit]] around one [[atomic nucleus]]. The atomic [[ion]]s and free electrons mix around like a hot soup.  Because the positive and negative [[electric charge|charged]] particles are not stuck together, plasma is a good [[conduction|conductor]] of [[electricity]]. For example, air is not good at conducting electricity. However, in a bolt of [[lightning]], the atoms in air get so much energy that they no longer can hold on to their electrons, and become a plasma for a brief time. Then an [[electric current]] is able to flow through the plasma, making the lightning.  Plasma is the most common state of matter in the universe. Both [[stars]] and the [[interstellar medium]] are mostly made of plasma.  == Phase changes == Phases of matter can be changed by a number of things. The most common ones are [[temperature]] and [[pressure]]. Substances usually become a gas at warm temperatures and/or low pressures, become a solid at cool temperatures, and become a plasma at extremely hot temperatures. Substances often become liquid in between solid and gas, but when the pressure is very low (such as the [[vacuum]] of outer space) many substances skip the liquid phase, going directly from solid to gas or vice versa. Scientists have created [[Graph|graphs]] called phase change diagrams to show the relationship between pressure, temperature, and phase of many substances.  When a solid becomes a liquid, it is called [[melt]]ing. When a liquid becomes a solid, it is called [[freezing]]. When a solid becomes a gas, it is called [[sublimation]]. When a gas becomes a solid, it is called [[desublimation]]. When a liquid becomes a gas, it is called [[evaporation]]. When a gas becomes a liquid, it is called [[condensation]].  The freezing point and the melting point are said to be the same, because any increase in temperature from that point will cause the substance to melt, while any drop in temperature will cause it to freeze. Likewise, the vaporization and condensation points (or the sublimation and desublimation points) always match. In most substances, as the pressure increases, the vaporization/condensation point also increases, or vice versa. For example, the boiling point of [[water]] decreases as you go up a mountain, because the air pressure is lower. The relationship for freezing and melting can go in different directions depending on the substance.  == Other states == Many other states of matter can exist under special conditions, including [[strange matter]], [[Supersolid|supersolids]], and possibly [[string-net liquid]]s. Scientist work on experiments at very high or very low temperatures to learn more about phases of matter.  === Condensates === [[Bose Einstein Condensation|Bose-Einstein condensates]] and [[fermionic condensate]]s are phases of matter that apply to [[particle]]s called [[boson]]s and [[fermion]]s, respectively. (More than one boson can exist in the same spot at the same time. Only one fermion can exist in the same spot at the same time). Bose-Einstein condensates and fermionic condensates occur at incredibly low temperatures. All of the particles in these condensates begin to act like one big [[quantum state]], so they have almost no [[friction]] or [[electrical resistance]].  === Degenerate matter === When the core of a [[star]] runs out of light elements (like hydrogen or helium) to sustain [[fusion]], the core will collapse into a very dense state called ''degenerate matter''. Everything is packed very tightly and can barely move. If the star isn't too heavy, it becomes a [[white dwarf]]. In a heavier star, the pressure is so intense that even the [[protons]] and [[electrons]] are crushed, and it becomes a [[neutron star]].  === Quark-gluon plasmas === The [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s that make up atoms are made of even smaller things called [[quark]]s (which are "glued" together by things called "[[gluons]]"). At incredibly high temperatures over 2 trillion [[Kelvin]], quarks and gluons turn into another state of matter. Humans can make a little bit of quark-gluon plasma in the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]], but it doesn't last long before cooling down.  === Supercritical fluids === When a substance has enough temperature and pressure at the same time, called the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], you can't tell the  difference between very dense gas and very energetic liquid. This is a supercritical fluid, and it behaves like both liquid and gas.  === Superfluids === [[Superfluidity|Superfluids]], on the other hand, only happen at very low temperatures, and only for a few special substances like liquid [[helium]]. Superfluids can do things that regular liquids cannot, like flowing up the side of a bowl and getting out.  == Other websites == * [http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2005/matter.html 2005-06-22, MIT News: MIT physicists create new form of matter] Citat: "...
