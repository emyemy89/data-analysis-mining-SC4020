<title>List of communist parties</title><text>{{redlinks|date=February 2012}} There are a number of '''communist parties''' around the world.  The first communist parties were set up after the [[Russian Revolution]].  Their aim was to support the [[Bolsheviks]] (the [[Russia]]n communists).    In world history, the Russian and [[China|Chinese]] communists are very important.  In Western Europe, the French, Spanish and Italian communist parties are the biggest.  They have taken part in either local, regional or central government in those countries.  Some communist parties have different names, such as Socialist Party, Socialist Workers Party, or Workers Party.
