<title>Great Plains</title><text>[[File: Map of Great Plains.svg|thumb|[[Map]] of the Great Plains with a red line showing the 100th meridian]]  The '''Great Plains''' is a [[plain|large space of level land]] or [[prairie]] in the middle and western parts of [[North America]]. It is a [[steppe]] or [[grassland]].  The western boundary is the [[Rocky Mountains]].  In the east, the Great Plains [[grassland]] becomes the [[tallgrass]] of the [[Mississippi River]] basin. The prairie is (in whole or part) in eleven states, and in the southern parts of three [[Canadian province]]s.  In the Great Plains, summers are hot and humid, but winters are cold. [[Bison]] used to number millions, and were the main food for people there. Now the area is mainly sown with [[cereal]] [[crops]] which feed cattle and people.  == Other websites == *[http://www.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/govdocs/text/greatplains/text.html North Dakota State University: ''The Geologic Story of The Great Plains''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305001133/http://www.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/govdocs/text/greatplains/text.html |date=2009-03-05 }} *[http://www.kansasheritage.org/prairie/ Kansas Heritage Group: ''Native Prairie, Preserve, Flowers, and Research''] *[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award97/ndfahtml/ngphome.html Library of Congress: ''Great Plains''] *[http://www.unl.edu/plains/ University of Nebraska-Lincoln: ''The Great Plains Study'']   {{multistub|US-geo|Canada}}  [[Category:Plains]] [[Category:Regions of Canada]] [[Category:Regions of the United States]]</text>
