He was born in [[Maida Vale]], London.<ref>Newman M.H.A. 1955. Alan Mathison Turing. 19121954. ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' '''1''': 253. [http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/253]</ref>  == Early life and family == Alan Turing was born in Maida Vale, [[London]] on 23 June 1912. His father was part of a family of [[merchant]]s from Scotland. His mother, Ethel Sara, was the [[daughter]] of an [[engineer]].  === Education === Turing went to St. Michael's, a school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-sea, when he was five years old. "This is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is going to be.  Alan Turing.  The Stoney family were once prominent landlords, here in North Tipperary. His mother Ethel Sara Stoney (18811976) was daughter of Edward Waller Stoney (Borrisokane, North Tipperary) and Sarah Crawford (Cartron Abbey, Co. Longford); Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry.  Educated in Dublin at Alexandra School and College; on October 1st 1907 she married Julius Mathison Turing, latter son of Reverend John Robert Turing and Fanny Boyd, in Dublin. Born on June 23rd 1912, Alan Turing would go on to be regarded as one of the greatest figures of the twentieth century.  A brilliant mathematician and cryptographer Alan was to become the founder of modern-day computer science and artificial intelligence; designing a machine at Bletchley Park to break secret Enigma encrypted messages used by the Nazi German war machine to protect sensitive commercial, diplomatic and military communications during World War 2. Thus, Turing made the single biggest contribution to the Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany, possibly saving the lives of an estimated 2 million people, through his effort in shortening World War II.  In 2013, almost 60 years later, Turing received a posthumous Royal Pardon from Queen Elizabeth II. Today, the Turing law grants an automatic pardon to men who died before the law came into force, making it possible for living convicted gay men to seek pardons for offences now no longer on the statute book.  Alas, Turing accidentally or otherwise lost his life in 1954, having been subjected by a British court to chemical castration, thus avoiding a custodial sentence. He is known to have ended his life at the age of 41 years, by eating an apple laced with cyanide  == Career == Turing was one of the people who worked on the first [[computers]]. He created the theoretical  [[Turing machine]] in 1936. The machine was [[Imagination|imaginary]], but it included the idea of a [[computer program]].  Turing was interested in [[artificial intelligence]]. He proposed the [[Turing test]], to say when a machine could be called "[[Intelligence|intelligent]]". A computer could be said to "think" if a human talking with it could not tell it was a machine.<ref>Harnad, Stevan 2008.

In: Epstein, Robert & Peters, Grace (eds) ''Parsing the Turing Test: philosophical and methodological issues in the quest for the thinking computer''. Springer</ref>  During [[World War II]], Turing worked with others to break [[Germany|German]] [[cipher]]s (secret messages). He  worked for the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&CS) at [[Bletchley Park]], Britain's codebreaking centre that produced [[Ultra]] intelligence. Using [[cryptanalysis]], he helped to break the codes of the [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] machine. After that, he worked on other German codes.  From 1945 to 1947, Turing worked on the design of the [[ACE (computer)|ACE]] (Automatic Computing Engine) at the [[National Physical Laboratory]]. He presented a paper on 19 February 1946. That paper was "the first detailed design of a [[stored-program computer]]".<ref>Copeland, B. Jack 2006. ''Colossus: The secrets of Bletchley Park's code-breaking computers''. Oxford University Press. p108 {{ISBN|978-0-19-284055-4}}</ref> Although it was possible to build ACE, there were delays in starting the project. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. While he was at Cambridge, the [[Pilot ACE]] was built without him. It ran its first program on 10&nbsp;May 1950.  == Private life == Turing was a [[homosexual]] man. In 1952, he admitted having had sex with a man in [[England]]. At that time, [[homosexual]] acts were illegal. Turing was [[conviction|convicted]]. He had to choose between going to [[jail]] and taking [[hormone]]s to lower his sex drive. He decided to take the hormones.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letters of Note: Yours in distress, Alan |last=Turing |first=Alan |year=1952 |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/yours-in-distress-alan.html |archivedate=December 16, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CxLiSeL9?url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/yours-in-distress-alan.html |access-date=January 28, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After his punishment, he became [[erectile dysfunction|impotent]].

The cyanide came from either an [[apple]] which was poisoned with [[cyanide]], or from water that had cyanide in it. The reason for the confusion is that the police never tested the apple for cyanide.<ref>Hodges, Andrew 1983. ''Alan Turing: the enigma''. London: Burnett Books, p488. {{ISBN|0-04-510060-8}}</ref> It is also suspected that he committed suicide.  The treatment forced on him is now believed to be very wrong. It is against [[medical ethics]] and international laws of [[human rights]]. In August 2009, a [[petition]] asking the [[British Government]] to apologise to Turing for punishing him for being a homosexual was started.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Thousands call for Turing apology |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8226509.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=31 August 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | title = Petition seeks apology for Enigma code-breaker Turing |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/09/01/alan.turing.petition/index.html | publisher=CNN | date = 1 September 2009 | accessdate =1 September 2009}}</ref> The petition received thousands of signatures.<ref>The petition was only open to UK citizens.</ref> [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] acknowledged the petition.
