It is both a city and one of the [[States of Germany]].  With a [[population]] of about 1.73 [[million]] (1730000) it is the biggest German city after [[Berlin]] and the sixth largest city of the [[European Union]]. The religion is about 37% Protestant, 10% Catholic, 8% Muslim, 38% agnostic, 2% Pagan.  Since it was an important member of the [[Hanseatic League]], the city's official name still includes ''Hansestadt'' (Hanseatic city). Other German cities that do the same today are: [[Lbeck]], [[Rostock]], [[Wismar]], [[Stralsund]], [[Bremen]], [[Greifswald]] and [[Demmin]]. The membership in this trade alliance has influenced the architecture of the city to a great extent. It has also left some marks in the region around the city. [[Strategic bombing]] in World War II devastated the city.  In 2017 a consulting company ranked it 17th for best place to live in the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mercer.com/qualityoflivingpr#city-rankings|title=Vienna tops Mercer's 19th Quality of Living ranking|access-date=2018-05-16}}</ref>  The [[area]] of Hamburg is {{convert|755.16|km2|sqmi|1|lk=on|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internetagentur-seo-hamburg.de/|title=Internetagentur Hamburg|website=www.internetagentur-seo-hamburg.de}}</ref> It has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'' in the [[Koeppen climate classification]]).  == Economy == Hamburg's [[harbour]] is, by shipments, the second largest harbour in Europe (after [[Rotterdam]]) and among the ten largest in the world. It is a very important gate to the countries along the [[Baltic Sea]] and Eastern Europe.  There are about 120,000 businesses in Hamburg.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hamburg-economy.de/res/downloads/wirtschaftsstandort_hh.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-28 |archive-date=2008-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012015249/http://hamburg-economy.de/res/downloads/wirtschaftsstandort_hh.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> The company [[Airbus]] has an assembly plant for large civil [[aircraft]] in Hamburg. 30,000 people are employed in Hamburg's aircraft industries. There are only two other locations worldwide in this scale, [[Seattle]] in the [[United States]] and [[Toulouse]] in [[France]].  About half of Germany's nationwide newspapers and magazines are made in Hamburg. Germany's most-viewed television news ''[[Tagesschau]]'' is broadcast from Hamburg.  Hamburg's [[red-light district]] (in [[Sankt Pauli]]) is the largest in Europe.
