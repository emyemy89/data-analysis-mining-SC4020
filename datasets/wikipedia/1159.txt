<title>Ulster</title><text>[[Image:Flag of Ulster.svg|right|250px]] [[Image:Coat of arms of Ulster.svg|right|90px]] '''Ulster''' is one of the four [[Provinces of Ireland|historical provinces]] which make up the island of [[Ireland]]. The others are [[Leinster]], [[Munster]] and [[Connacht]].   There are nine [[county|counties]] in Ulster. Three of them are in the [[Republic of Ireland]]: *[[County Cavan]] *[[County Donegal]] *[[County Monaghan]]   The other six counties make up all of [[Northern Ireland]], which is part of the [[United Kingdom]]: *[[County Antrim]] *[[County Armagh]] *[[County Down]] *[[County Fermanagh]] *[[County Londonderry]] *[[County Tyrone]]  Because most of Ulster is in Northern Ireland, the name "Ulster" is also sometimes used to mean ''Northern Ireland'', even though Northern Ireland is only part of Ulster. This is called ''[[totum pro parte]]'' in [[Latin]] which means "the whole for a part".  {{Counties of Ireland}} {{multistub|Geo|Europe}} {{UK-stub}} {{authority control}} [[Category:Ulster| ]]</text>
