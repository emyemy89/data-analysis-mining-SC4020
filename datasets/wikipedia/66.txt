He was from [[Portugal]] and the Portuguese [[kingdom]] claimed Brazil. Soon, Portugal [[Colonization|colonized]] Brazil and created colonies all along the coastline.

In the late 1500s and early 1600s, the Dutch and the French tried to take land in Brazil. Dutch, French, and Portuguese started moving inland further than the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] said they could. This caused some fights with the Spaniards (people from [[Spain]]) and indigenous peoples in the area.<ref name="Britannica" />  In 1822, Brazil claimed to be its own country and not a part of [[Portugal]] anymore. Soon there was [[civil war]]. Meanwhile, the quilombos survived and Brazil was bringing in more slaves than any other country in the Americas, even though many countries were beginning to legally [[Abolitionism|abolish]] slavery. This led to an increase in slave revolts, especially in the 1860s and 1880s, which forced the government to change the system in order to keep the country stable.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2020-02-10|title=Isadora Moura Mota on Slavery and Anglo-American Abolitionism in the Age of Emancipation|url=https://slaveryanditslegacies.yale.edu/news/isadora-moura-mota-slavery-and-anglo-american-abolitionism-age-emancipation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-25|website=Slavery and Its Legacies|publisher=[[Yale University]]}}</ref> Slavery was legally abolished in 1888.
