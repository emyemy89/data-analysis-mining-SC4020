<title>Gross domestic product</title><text>In [[economics]], '''gross domestic product''' ('''GDP''') is how much a place produces in an amount of time. GDP can be calculated by adding up its [[output]] inside the borders of that [[country]].   To find the GDP of a country, one adds up all consumer spending (C), all investment (I), all government spending minus taxes (G), and the value of exports minus imports (''X  M''). This is shown by the equation:<blockquote><math>GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)</math></blockquote> This measure is often used to find out how healthy a country is; a country with a high value of GDP can be called a large economy. The United States has the largest GDP in the world.<ref>Economic Power in a Changing International System - Page 25, Ewan W. Anderson, Ivars Gutmanis, Liam D. Anderson - 2000</ref> Germany has the largest in [[Europe]],<ref>OECD Reviews of Regulatory Reform, 2004, p 92</ref> Nigeria in [[Africa]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2014/04/12/africas-new-number-one|title=Africas new Number One|date=12 April 2014|publisher=|via=The Economist}}</ref> and [[China]] in Asia.<ref>China and the World Economy, Yih-chyi Chuang, Simona Thomas - 2010</ref>  There are different ways to calculate the GDP. Nominal GDP is the total amount of money spent on all new and final goods in an economy, real GDP (adjusting for changes in prices) tries to correct this number for [[inflation]]. For example, if the prices rise by 2% (meaning, everything costs 2% more) and the nominal GDP grows by 5%, the real GDP growth is only increased by 3%.   GDP per capita is the total income of a [[country]], divided by the number of inhabitants. It shows how rich people, on [[average]], are.  == Gross national product == The GDP measure is different from '''gross national product''' (GNP) in that GNP = GDP + net income from assets in other countries ([[net income receipts]]).  == Nominal GDP == When the gross domestic product is [[wikt:evaluate|evaluate]]d at the current [[market]] prices, it is called the nominal GDP.<ref name=nomIP>{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominalgdp.asp?lgl=no-infinite |title=Nominal GDP |author= |website= |publisher=Investopedia, LLC |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}</ref> It includes changes in [[price]]s which makes it different from the real GDP.<ref name=nomIP/> These changes can be due to [[inflation]] or price [[wikt:fluctuation|fluctuation]]s.<ref name=nomIP/> It can be [[wikt:measure|measure]]d in one of three different ways.
