The [[Soviet Union]] and countries that it was friends with used the word cosmonaut. Western countries including the [[United States]] said astronaut. Astronauts are also called "taikonauts" in [[China]] or "spationaute" in [[France]].  The first person to go into space was a [[Russia]]n from the [[Soviet Union]]. His name was [[Yuri Gagarin]]. This happened on [[Vostok 1|April 12, 1961]]. The first and second people to walk on the [[Moon]] were the [[United States|American]]s [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]]. This happened on [[Apollo 11|July 20, 1969]]. No astronauts have gone to the moon since 1972. No people have visited any other [[planet]]s yet.  Astronauts used to go into space using many different ways, but now they only go on the American [[SpaceX Crew-1]], the Russian [[Soyuz]], or the Chinese Shenzhou. Several countries have worked together to build an [[International Space Station]] where people stay and work in space for long periods of time.  A few countries and companies are trying to make more ways to get people into space. The United States is building a very big rocket called the [[Space Launch System]]. Some American companies, for example [[Boeing]], [[Lockheed Martin]], and [[SpaceX]], are being paid by the United States to make ways for people to go to space.  == Related pages == * [[Spaceflight]]  {{science-stub}}  [[Category:Astronauts| ]]</text>
