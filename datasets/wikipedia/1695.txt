<title>Electrical cell</title><text>An '''electrical cell''' is a [[machine|device]] used to generate [[electricity]], or to make [[chemical reaction]]s  by applying electricity. A [[battery]] is one or more cells, connected. This cell is also known as electrochemical cell.  == Cells producing electricity == The simple electrical cells were first developed in 1800s.<ref name="magnet">{{cite web|url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/java/electricalcell/index.html|title = Interactive tutorials: Simple electrical cell|publisher = Mag Lab Education|accessdate = 2007-07-10}}</ref> They are also called ''galvanic cells'', because an [[Italy|Italian]] scientist named [[Luigi Galvani]] invented these cells.  Special [[chemical reaction]]s which occur inside the electrical cell, result in [[oxidation]] and [[reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] of the substances inside the cell.<ref name="magnet" /> This produces electrical energy. Normal batteries work like this.  Some electrical cells produce electricity without using chemical energy. For example, [[solar cell]]s produce electricity when they are exposed to sun light.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ktf-split.hr/glossary/en_o.php?def=electrical%20cell|title = Electrical cell|publisher = Chemistry Dictionary and Glossary|accessdate = 2007-07-10|archive-date = 2007-06-14|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070614053816/http://www.ktf-split.hr/glossary/en_o.php?def=electrical%20cell|url-status = dead}}</ref>  A plate of [[zinc]] and a plate of [[copper]] immersed in a [[dilution|dilute]] [[solution]] which contains [[acid]] or [[salt]] is an example of the [[chemical reaction]] based cell. The solution acts as an [[electrolyte]] (electric conductor). When the two plates are connected to a current meter with a wire, electric current will pass; this is because [[oxidation]] and [[reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] processes take place in this chemical reaction turning the zinc plate to a negative [[electrode]] and the copper plate to a positive [[electrode]], and so the [[electron]]s flow from zinc to copper.  == Cells using electricity == Some chemical reactions need high energy to happen. An example is the breakdown of [[water]] into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-07-10  |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/electrolytic-cell-1  |title = Electrolytic cell  |publisher=Answers.com}}</ref> An electrical cell (or an "electrolytic cell") is used for these reactions. It is a container which has to have a chemical reaction involving [[electrode]]s. The chemical substances are exposed to electrical power, and the [[electrolysis]] reaction happens inside the electrical cell.  Two pieces of metal are placed in water that has a little [[electrolyte]] such as [[hydrochloric acid]], [[sulfuric acid]], [[sodium bicarbonate]], or [[sodium hydroxide]] added to it. An electric current is applied and gas comes out of each electrode. Some greenish-brown color may be seen too if iron was used.   There may also be a chemical reaction which will result in the explosion of the iron and has a strong blast radius (safety goggles recommended).  ==Related pages== * [[Battery]]  == References == {{reflist}}   [[Category:Tools]] [[Category:Electricity]]</text>
