So Zong orders his soldiers to bury the enemy dead and hold funeral mournings. Lasting peace is then made.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}  === Buddha and the origin of Daoism === [[Sima Qian]] says Laozi was tired of the moral decay in [[Chengzhou]]. The kingdom was declining. He traveled west and lived on the frontier until 80. He was recognized by the guard [[Yinxi]] at a western gate. Yinxi asked Laozi to write his wisdom. This became the Daodejing. But the present version of the text includes additions from later periods. In some versions of the tale, Yinxi liked the work so much that he became a student and left with Laozi, never to be seen again.<ref>{{Harvard citation text|Kohn|Lafargue|1998|pp=14, 17, 5455}}</ref> In others, the "Old Master" traveled all the way to [[India]] and was the teacher of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the [[Buddha]].

Yinxi wanted to find the ''Tao'' and said his long study of astrology allowed him to recognize Laozi. Yinxi was accepted by Laozi as a student. This shows the testing a seeker must undergo before being accepted as a student of a master.<ref>{{Harvard citation text|Kohn|Lafargue|1998|p=55}}</ref>  Yinxi then trains. After completing the training, the two go to the western lands of the barbarians. They reached the highest religious rank in medieval Taoism called "Preceptor of the Three Caverns". Laozi is the perfect Taoist master and Yinxi is the ideal Taoist student. Laozi is the living''Tao'' personified, teaching others for salvation.<ref>{{Harvard citation text|Kohn|Lafargue|1998|pp=5556}}</ref>  The story of Laozi became religious since the [[Han dynasty]]. As [[Taoism]] became more popular, Laozi was worshipped as a god. The [[Way of the Celestial Masters]] became the first Taoist [[sect]]. Later Taoists view Laozi as the ''Dao'' in human form. Religious Taoism says that Laozi did not disappear after writing the Daodejing but spent his whole life traveling and revealing the Dao to others.<ref name="Kohn 3-4" />  ==Daoism== {{Main|Taoism}} Laozi is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoism. Popular Taoism typically presents the [[Jade Emperor]] as the main [[deity]]. Intellectual Taoists, such as the [[Way of the Celestial Masters|Celestial Masters sect]], usually present Laozi (''Laojun'', , "Lord Lao") and the [[Three Pure Ones]] at the main gods.<ref>{{Harvard citation text|Maspero|1981|p=41}}</ref><ref>{{Harvard citation text|Robinet|1997|p=63}}</ref>  ===''Daodejing''=== {{Main|Tao Te Ching|Tao|Wu wei}} [[File:Yin_yang.svg|link=https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yin_yang.svg|right|thumb|The "[[Yin and yang|taiji]] symbol" ().]]Laozi is traditionally regarded as the author of the ''[[Tao Te Ching|Daodejing]]'', but this is disputed.<ref>{{Harvard citation text|Simpkins|Simpkins|1999|pp=1113}}</ref><ref>{{Harvard citation text|Morgan|2001|p=223}}</ref> It is one of the most significant books in Chinese [[cosmogony]]. Like other ancient [[Chinese philosophers]], Laozi often explains his ideas using paradox, analogy, ancient sayings, repetition, rhyme, and rhythm. In fact, the whole book can be read as an analogy: the ruler is the self, and the others and empire are the body, senses, and desires.  The ''Daodejing'' says the ''Dao'' is the source and ideal of all existence: it is unseen, very powerful but also very humble, being the root of all things. People have desires and free will. Many act "unnaturally", breaking the natural balance of the Dao. The Daodejing intends to lead students to "return" to their natural state, in harmony with Tao.<ref>{{Harvard citation text|Van Norden|Ivanhoe|2005|p=162}}</ref> Taoism views them language as biased and artificial and shows this through paradoxes.<ref name="Kohn-22">{{Harvard citation text|Kohn|2000|p=22}}</ref>  Another example: [[technology]] may give a false sense of progress. Laozi says not to reject technology, but instead seek the calm state of ''wu wei'' (), without desires. Laozi says rulers should keep their people ignorant or simple-minded. This may be political advice, but it could also be religious. The text uses terms like "valley spirit" (''gushen'') and "soul" (''po'').<ref name="Kohn-22"/>  ''[[Wu wei]]'' literally "non-action" or "not acting", is an important concept. The concept is multifaceted, and this is shown by how it can mean many different things and be translated in multiple ways; it can mean "not doing anything", "not forcing", "not acting" (as in movies or drama), "creating nothingness", "acting spontaneously", and "flowing with the moment".<ref>{{Harvard citation text|Watts|1975|pp=7886}}</ref>  It is used to explain ''[[ziran]]'' (), or harmony with the ''Tao''. It says all ambition originates from the same source. Laozi used the term to mean [[simplicity]] and [[humility]] as key virtues, in contrast to selfishness. Politically, it means avoiding war, harsh laws and heavy taxes. Some Taoists see a connection between ''wu wei'' and [[esoteric]] practices, such as ''[[zuowang]]'' (, "sitting in oblivion", emptying the mind of thought) found in the [[Zhuangzi]].<ref name="Kohn-22"/>  == Influence: anarchy, libertarianism, and limited government == {{Wikiquote}}{{Commons category|Laozi}}Laozi and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] influenced many people throughout Chinese history. Zhuangzi was Laozi's most famous follower. Zhuangzi had a great deal of influence on Chinese scholars, bureaucrats, and culture. Politicians have used Laozi's philosophies to deny serving their ruler. They valued humility in leadership and limited government. This was either out of morality or for their own political means. Some anti-authoritarian movements used Laozi teachings to represent the power of the weak.<ref>{{Harvard citation text|Roberts|2004|pp=12}}</ref>  Laozi supported limited government.<ref>{{Harvard citation text|Dorn|2008|pp=282283}}</ref> [[Left-libertarianism|Left-libertarians]] have been influenced by Laozi.
