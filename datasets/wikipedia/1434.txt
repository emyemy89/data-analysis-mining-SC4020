<title>Das Lied der Deutschen</title><text>'''Das Lied der Deutschen''' ("The Song of the [[Germany|German]] people"), also known as '''Deutschlandlied''', ("The Song of Germany"), is a song written by [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Hoffmann von Fallersleben]]. Part of this song is the [[national anthem]] of [[Germany]] ([[Deutsche Nationalhymne|German National Anthem]]).  A line from this song, "Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit" ("[[Unity]] and [[:wikt:justice|justice]] and freedom") is the [[:wikt:motto|motto]] of Germany.  ==History== The [[music]] was written by Haydn in [[1797]] as the [[national anthem|anthem]] of [[Austria]]. It was called "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser" ("God protect our [[Emperor]] [[Francis I of Austria|Franz]]"). The words which are used today were written by the poet August Heinrich Hoffman von Fallersleben in [[1841]].   Today, the first line "Germany, Germany above all" sounds too strong for some people, and is often misunderstood. Fallersleben wanted a united Germany when he wrote it. At that time, Germany was not one [[country]], but many small [[country|countries]]. So "Germany above all" meant that the most important thing to do was to have a unified Germany. Also, the poet was in [[Heligoland]], where people spoke German but were ruled by the [[Great Britain|British]].  Fallersleben's music was very popular in Germany during the second part of the 19th century. This song was not a [[national anthem]] then, but a song for people who loved the idea of a strong and united Germany. In 1918, it replaced the anthem of the [[German Empire]] "Heil Dir im Siegerkranz" ("Praise to the war-winner"), when the [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Emperor Wilhelm II]] lost power at the end of the [[First World War]]. In 1921, a "fourth [[stanza]]", a new part or verse, was written by poet Albert Matthai with words about the difficult life in Germany at that time. It was not sung very often.  During the time of [[Hitler]], only the first part of the song was used. This was often followed by a [[NSDAP|Nazi]] party song. This part of the song was difficult for some people who were not Germans because it has words describing Germany as a country that included land that was in other countries.  After the [[Second World War]], Germany was divided into two countries. In 1949, the new [[Federal Republic of Germany|Western Germany]] tried to get a new song for the national anthem. Another song was chosen, written by poet [[Rudolf Alexander Schrder]]. It was not very popular. Finally, the third part of the Fallersleben song was made into the national anthem.  In the other part of Germany, the [[German Democratic Republic|Eastern Germany]], the words of poet [[Johannes R. Becher]] ("Auferstanden aus Ruinen" - "Re-built from the Ruins") were used with a song written by [[Hanns Eisler]]. It was not very popular, and from the 1970s the words were not sung, because of the line "Germany, [our] unified fatherland".  After East and West Germany united again in 1990, the Fallersleben song again became the national anthem of Germany but only the third part is used. Today, the first part of the song is popular with [[nationalist]] [[extremist]]s.  {| border="0" noborder |----- | ==German words of the song== | ==Close translation== |----- | col="2" | ===First stanza=== |----- | :'''D'''eutschland, Deutschland ber alles, :ber alles in der Welt, :wenn es stets zu Schutz und Trutze :brderlich zusammenhlt. :Von der Maas bis an die Memel, :von der Etsch bis an den Belt, :|: Deutschland, Deutschland ber alles, :ber alles in der Welt! :| | :'''G'''ermany, Germany above all, :above anything in the world, :when always for [[protect]]ion :we stand together as [[brother]]s. : from the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] river (west of Germany) to the [[Nemen]] river (east of [[Poland]]), :from the [[Adige]] river ([[Italy|Italian border]]) to the Belt (the sea near [[Denmark]]). :|: Germany, Germany above all, :above anything in the world. :| |----- | col="2" | ===Second stanza=== |----- | :'''D'''eutsche Frauen, deutsche Treue, :deutscher Wein und deutscher Sang :sollen in der Welt behalten :ihren alten schnen Klang, :uns zu edler Tat begeistern :unser ganzes Leben lang. - :|: Deutsche Frauen, deutsche Treue, :deutscher Wein und deutscher Sang! :| | :'''G'''erman women, German [[wikt:faith|faithfulness]], :German wine and German songs :should continue to get approval :all over the world, :and help us to do great work :all our life. :|: German women, German faithfulness, :German wine and German songs! :| |----- | col="2" | ===Third stanza - the [[Deutsche Nationalhymne|German National Anthem]]=== |----- | :'''E'''inigkeit und Recht und Freiheit :fr das deutsche Vaterland! :Danach lasst uns alle streben :brderlich mit Herz und Hand! :Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit :sind des Glckes Unterpfand; :|: blh im Glanze dieses Glckes, :blhe, deutsches Vaterland. :| | :'''U'''nity and justice and liberty  :for the German fatherland ; :After these let us all strive together, :as brothers, with heart and hands. :[[Unity]] and [[:wikt:justice|justice]] and liberty :are the pledge for good fortune; :|: Flourish in the splendour of such fortune, :flourish, German fatherland. :| |----- |} __NOTOC__  ==Related pages== *[[Deutsche Nationalhymne|German National Anthem]]  [[Category:Germany]] [[Category:National anthems]] [[Category:Mottos]]</text>
