It is one of the longest rivers in the world. Its largest city is [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The name "Mississippi" comes from a [[Native American]] name that means "big river." The source of the Mississippi is [[Lake Itasca]] in [[Minnesota]], near the border with [[Canada]]. The Mississippi flows south through the middle of the [[United States]]. It flows through the [[States of the United States|states]] of Minnesota, [[Wisconsin]], [[Iowa]], [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Mississippi]]. The mouth of the Mississippi is in the state of [[Louisiana]], south of the city of [[New Orleans]]. The Mississippi flows into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  At the end of the Mississippi there is a [[wikt:zone|zone]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] where very few [[animal]]s can survive comfortably because of the [[fertilizer]] and other [[chemical]]s that run off of farms into the river and its tributaries. The rivers then carry them into the [[Gulf of Mexico|gulf]].<ref>[http://toxics.usgs.gov/hypoxia/hypoxic_zone.html Hypoxic zone-USGS]</ref>  ==Transportation==  The Mississippi has been very important for transportation in the [[history]] of the United States. In the 1800s, many [[steamboat|steamboats]] traveled on the Mississippi River. [[St. Louis, Missouri]], [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and New Orleans were important [[Port|port cities]].  ==Tributaries==  The Mississippi has many large [[tributary|tributaries]], or [[River|rivers]] that flow into it. The [[watershed]] of the Mississippi covers much of the United States. This means that the Mississippi and its tributaries drain much of the United States.  Some important tributaries of the Mississippi are (listed from the source to the mouth of the river):  {| class="wikitable sortable" |- ! River |- | the [[Minnesota River]] |- | the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix River]] |- | the [[Wisconsin River]] |- | the [[Illinois River]] |- | the [[Missouri River]] |- | the [[Ohio River]] |- | the [[Arkansas River]] |}  == The Mississippi River in books == A big part of the book ''[[Huckleberry Finn]]'' by [[Mark Twain]] is set on the Mississippi River. Twain also wrote a book called ''Life on the Mississippi'', which had some stories about how he used to work on a steamboat.  == References == {{reflist|2}} {{authority control}} [[Category:Rivers of Minnesota]] [[Category:Rivers of Arkansas]] [[Category:Rivers of Illinois]] [[Category:Rivers of Iowa]] [[Category:Rivers of Kentucky]] [[Category:Rivers of Louisiana]] [[Category:Rivers of Mississippi]] [[Category:Rivers of Missouri]] [[Category:Rivers of Tennessee]] [[Category:Rivers of Wisconsin]]</text>
