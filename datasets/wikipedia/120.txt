People think this could be Colchester Abbey, after it was ruined.'']]  The '''dissolution of the monasteries''' was an event that happened from 1536 to 1540, when [[England|English]] King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] took away the land and money that the nuns and monks of the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] church owned. Henry VIII then gave this land and money to people that supported him.  This was also when Henry VIII made himself the new head of the [[Church of England]] (which is a type of [[Christianity]]). Parliament made the [[Act of Supremacy]] to give him the right to do both these things. It was part of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in England.  {{Spoken Wikipedia|Dissolution of the monasteries.ogg|19 July 2006}}  {{religion-stub}}  [[Category:History of the British Isles]] [[Category:Anglicanism]] [[Category:Protestant Reformation]]</text>
