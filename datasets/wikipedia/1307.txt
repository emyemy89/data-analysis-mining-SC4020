<title>Murder</title><text>[[File:Jakub Schikaneder - Murder in the House.JPG|thumb|472x472px|Murder in the House is a painting by Jakub Schikaneder, done in 1890. ]] '''Murder''' is when one [[person]] [[kill]]s another person on [[wikt:purpose|purpose]]. If a person does something that makes someone else die, without the intent of killing, it is homicide and may be [[manslaughter]]. An [[accident]] caused by carelessness may be [[negligent homicide]]. Sometimes, a death caused by someone else may not be a [[crime]], for example killing in [[self-defense]].  A person who commits murder is called a murderer. The [[legal]] [[definition]] of "murder" and "manslaughter" may be different in different [[country|countries]], and is very much argued on: for example, killing in war is not usually called "murder" by those who fight in the war. Killing in [[self defense]] (if people being attacked with death seeming imminent kill the attacker, or someone kills an intruder who has burglarized their dwelling) is usually not "murder", but sometimes manslaughter.  Many countries do not even have manslaughter as a legal concept, and only have murder; the countries that do not have manslaughter charge with murder instead.  In fact, the United States did not have manslaughter on the books until the 20th century.  England was the first country to indoctrinate manslaughter, and the United States was second.  == Most common circumstances for murder in the United States (1999) == A total of 12,658 murders were reported in 1999 in the U.S., including 1,903 without a specified reason, and 3,779 for which the reasons were unknown.  # Argument (unspecified) (3,391) # Robbery (1,010) # Juvenile gang killing (579) # Contravention of narcotic drug laws (564) # Argument over money or property (211) # Brawl due to influence of alcohol (187) # Romantic triangle (133) # Gangland killing (116) # Brawl due to influence of narcotics (111) # Burglary (79)  == Worst cities for murder in the United States (1999) == New York's status as the murder capital of the world improved during the 1990s.  What follows are the number of murders for 1999: # [[New York]], New York (671) # [[Chicago]], Illinois (642) # [[Los Angeles]], California (425) # [[Detroit]], Michigan (415) # [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania (292) # [[Houston]], Texas (241) # [[Washington, D.C.]] (241) # [[Dallas]], Texas (191) # [[New Orleans]], Louisiana (158) # [[Atlanta]], Georgia (143)  == Attempted murder == Attempted murder is a crime. Attempted murder, or "attempt murder" in [[common law]] [[country|countries]], also sometimes called "murder attempt", is when someone tries to [[wikt:kill|kill]] another person.<ref name=Costa48>Michael Costa; Mark Duffy, ''Australian HIV/AIDS Legal Guide'' (Sydney: Federation Press, 1991), p. 48</ref> Just [[wikt:plan|plan]]ning a murder is not enough. The act must come close to, but does not actually take the life of the other person.<ref name=Costa48/>  It was punishable by death and the execution was carried out in Ancient Egypt, Ancient Mesopotamia, the Indus River Valley, Ancient Greece, The Roman Empire, and of course, China, which is by far the most populated country in the world, to this day.  As with murder, attempted murder is a [[mortal sin]] to the Catholic Church.  The Roman Empire carried out about ten thousand executions, most if not all beheadings, during its time, and there is no doubt that many of these were those convicted of attempted murder.  ==Assassination== "[[Assassination]]" is a word which means murdering a prominent person for a reason.  The word is most used when the person who was killed was a [[celebrity]] or was a person involved in [[politics]].  The people who carry out assassinations are called "assassins" or "Hit-men".  An assassin may murder someone for [[political]] reasons, for [[money]], or for other reasons, such as [[favor]]s owed and revenge.  Assassination is the same as murder and is [[mortal sin]] to the Catholic Church.  The word "Assassin" comes from [[Hashishin]],<ref>''American Speech'' - McCarthy, Kevin M. Volume 48, pp. 77-83</ref>  a [[Muslim]] group that was active in the [[Middle East]] from the 8th to the 14th centuries. This [[secret society]] killed people for [[politics|political]] and [[religion|religious]] reasons.<ref>Secret Societies Handbook, Michael Bradley, Cassell Illustrated, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1844034161}}</ref> It is thought that the assassins were under the [[influence]] of [[hashish]] and [[opium]] during their killings or during their training. The word ''assassin'' comes from either ''hashashim'', the influence of the drugs, or ''hassansin'', after their leader, [[Hassan-i Sabbah]].  == Murder{{ndash}}suicide == A '''murder{{ndash}}suicide''' is when a person kills someone else (murder), and then they kill themselves ([[suicide]]).  No one is tracking the number of murdersuicides in the [[United States]]. However, medical studies estimate between 1,000 and 1,500 deaths per year in the United States are murder-suicides.<ref>[http://www.vpc.org/studies/amroul2006.pdf American Roulette: MurderSuicide in the United States.
