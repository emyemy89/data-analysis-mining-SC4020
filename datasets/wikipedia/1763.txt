It is the world's 13th largest island. Around 140 million people live there, which is half the people in Indonesia and more than on any other island in the world. Most of them speak the [[Javanese language]] and many also speak other languages.   The [[Java Sea]] is to the north, the [[Indian Ocean]] south. The [[capital city]] of Indonesia, [[Jakarta]], is in Java.  == Climate == Most of Java has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (Am in the [[Koeppen climate classification]]). The northern [[coast]] of the island is low-lying. The [[soil]] is [[fertile]], because the island was made by [[volcano]]<nowiki/>es. It is an important area for growing [[crop]]s in [[Indonesia]].  == Gallery == <gallery> Image:Straat van soenda.jpg|[[Sunda Strait]] between Java and [[Sumatra]] Image:Mount Bromo at sunrise, showing its volcanoes and Mount Semeru (background).jpg|[[Mount Bromo]] is a [[volcano]] Image:Old harbour of Jakarta, 2005.jpg|The old [[harbour]] in [[Jakarta]] </gallery>  {{Indonesia}}  {{Asia-stub}}  {{commons}}  [[Category:Java| ]]</text>
