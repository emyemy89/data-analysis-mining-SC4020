About 1,060,000 people live there, making Cologne the biggest city in North Rhine-Westphalia. It is in the southern part of the '[[Rhine]]-[[Ruhr]] [[agglomeration]]' of cities with a combined total population of about 10 million people. This is one of the most densely populated areas of the world.  Cologne has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'' in the [[Koeppen climate classification]]).  ==History== The city was founded by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the year [[50 AD]]. Before that, it was a Roman castle ("[[castellum]]") and a town inhabited by a local German [[tribe]] named ''Ubier'' at least for 100 years. [[Archaeologist]]s have found out that the surrounding area was populated already during the [[Stone Age]].  Traditionally, the city was always [[Roman Catholic]]. That changed only recently after the [[Second World War]],as a result of massive immigration of [[Protestants]] from the [[East Germany|East of Germany]]. Still the largest number of people, 41.6%, are Roman Catholic, compared to 17% Protestant. 10% of the people are [[Muslim]].  ==Sights== The most interesting thing to see there is [[Cologne Cathedral]]. This [[church]] was built from about 1248 to about 1550, but completed only in 1880. The [[United Nations]] list it as 'World Cultural Heritage'. Cologne's archbishop [[Rainald von Dassel]] brought the [[relic]]s of the biblical [[Biblical Magi|Three Wise Men]] there in 1164. They are kept in a very beautiful [[Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral|golden shrine]] in the cathedral. Three golden crowns in the coat of arms of the city symbolize them. They made Cologne a major place of [[pilgrimage]].  The [[University of Cologne]] alone has more than 50,000 students. It was founded 1919 and is one of the biggest universities in Germany. There are several specialized Schools in addition to the university. The ''Hochschule fr Musik'' is the biggest Academy of [[Music]] in Europe. Cologne has two Colleges of [[Arts]] and the [[Sports]] College again is one of the biggest institutions of its kind worldwide.  Cologne has 31 [[museum]]s and has one of the busiest [[train station]]s in Europe. It is the only train station located next to a big cathedral.  ==Culture== People in Cologne and nearby have their own dialect. They call it [[Klsch (language)|Klsch]]. During [[Karneval|carnival]] time it even appears on nationwide broadcasts.  Cologne has a handful of broadcasting stations. The [[WDR|Westdeutscher Rundfunk]], part of the network [[ARD]], is the biggest producer of television and radio programs in Germany.  Cologne is also famous for [[Eau de Cologne]] (''Klnisch Wasser'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capturedplaces.com/cologne2/originaleaudecolognelogo.php|title=Eau de Cologne}}</ref>  ==Related pages== * [[Berlin]] * [[Bonn]] (nearby city) * [[Dsseldorf]] (nearby city) * [[Frankfurt/Main]] * [[Hamburg]] * [[Leverkusen]] (nearby city) * [[Munich]]  == References == {{reflist}}  == Other websites == {{Commonscat-inline|Cologne}} * [http://www.koeln.de German page on the city] * [http://www.uni-koeln.de German page of the University] * [http://www.koelner-dom.de German page of the cathedral] * [http://www.wdr.de German page of the broadcasting station ''Westdeutscher Rundfunk'']  {{Hanseatic League}} {{Cities in Germany}} {{north rhine-westphalia}} {{authority control}} [[Category:Cities with more than a million inhabitants]] [[Category:Cities in North Rhine-Westphalia]] [[Category:Cologne| ]] [[Category:1st century establishments in Europe]] [[Category:Establishments in Germany]] [[Category:50 establishments]]</text>
