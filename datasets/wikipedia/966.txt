It is [[culture|culturally]] considered to be part of [[Europe]].  Iceland is 301 kilometers east of [[Greenland]] and 1001 kilometers west of [[Norway]].  There are about 329,100 people who live in Iceland. Iceland has an area of 103,000&nbsp;km.  == History == The first people who lived on Iceland are thought to have been [[Ireland|Irish]] [[monk]]s. They came to Iceland around the year 800.  In the [[9th century]], [[Norsemen]] went to live in Iceland. The first Norseman who lived in Iceland was [[Flki Vilgerarson]]. He was also the one who gave Iceland its name. [[Inglfur Arnarson|Inglfur Arnarsons]] was the first permanent settler on the island<ref name = tomasson>{{Cite book|last = Tomasson|first = Richard F.|title = Iceland, the first new society|publisher = U of Minnesota Press|year = 1980|isbn = 0-8166-0913-6|page = 63}}</ref>. This [[chieftain]] from [[Norway]] went to live in South West Iceland and founded the city of [[Reykjavk]].  In 930, the Icelandic rulers wrote a [[constitution]]. They created the [[Althing]], a kind of [[parliament]] in a place called [[ingvellir]]. Therefore, Iceland is the oldest existing [[republic]].  In 985, [[Erik the Red]] was sent away from the island because he had killed someone. He sailed to the west and discovered [[Greenland]]. Eric's son [[Leif Ericson]] discovered [[The Americas|America]] in the year 1000. He called it [[Vinland]]. The voyages of Eric, Leif and others were written down in the [[saga]]s (long stories).  [[File:Gerardi Mercatoris Atlas, sive, Cosmographicae Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricati Figura (24696368309).jpg|thumb|left|A map of Iceland published in the early 17th century]]  In 1262, Iceland became part of [[Norway]]. This lasted for 400 years. In 1662, it became part of [[Denmark]]. In the [[19th century]], many Icelandic's wanted to be independent from Denmark. In 1918, Iceland got many powers of its own, but the [[king]] of Denmark was still king of Iceland.  When [[Germany]] took over Denmark on April 9 1940, the Althing decided that Icelandics  should rule the country themselves, but they did not declare independence yet. [[United Kingdom|British]] and later [[United States|American]] soldiers occupied Iceland to prevent it from being attacked by the Germans. In 1944, Iceland finally became fully independent.  After [[World War II]], Iceland became a member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), but not of the [[European Union]]. Between 1958 and 1976, there were three [[debates]] between Iceland and the [[United Kingdom]] about the rights to catch [[codfish]]. They were called the [[Cod War]]s.  In 1980, [[Vigds Finnbogadttir]] was elected [[president]] of Iceland. She was the first woman ever to be elected president of a country.  In 2016, [[Guni Th. Jhannesson]] become president of Iceland.  == Politics ==  Iceland has a [[multi-party system]]. Since the 2013 election, the [[Right-wing politics|center-right]] Independence Party and Progressive Party are the biggest [[Political party|political parties]] in Iceland. Other powerful parties in Iceland include the [[Left wing|center-left]] Social Democratic Alliance and Left-Green Movement. See also: [[List of political parties in Iceland]].  Iceland is a [[representative democracy]] and a [[parliamentary republic]]. Iceland has a [[president]] ([[Guni Th. Jhannesson]]<ref>{{cite web |last=Ansari |first=Azadeh |title= Iceland elects first new president in 20 years |url= http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/26/world/iceland-president-gudni-johannesson/|work=cnn.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2 August 2016 |author2= Hume, Tim}}</ref>) and a [[prime minister]] ([[Katrn Jakobsdttir]]). The [[parliament]], [[Althing]], has 63 members and each member can only be in there for four years<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.iceland.is/government-and-politics/|title = Government & Politics|publisher = Iceland.is|accessdate = 10 February 2010|archive-date = 18 January 2010|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100118153818/http://www.iceland.is/government-and-politics/|url-status = dead}}</ref>. The president is elected by Icelanders, and is in government for four years. The president can be elected an unlimited amount of times.  Iceland has no [[standing army]]. The [[United States Air Force]] had a base near [[Reykjanesbr]], but they left in 2006. Since 2008, [[NATO]] nations have occasionally had their air force patrol Iceland. This was requested by the Icelandic government<ref>{{Cite web|title = French Air Force in Iceland|url = http://www.mfa.is/speeches-and-articles/nr/4240|publisher = Ministry for Foreign Affairs|accessdate = 2 October 2010|date = 5 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Air Policing|url = http://www.aco.nato.int/page142085426.aspx|publisher = NATO Air Command Operations|accessdate = 2 October 2010}}</ref>.  === Divisions ===  Iceland is divided into 8 regions, 6 [[Constituency|constituencies]] and 74 [[Municipality|municipalities]] (since 2013). The regions are mainly used for statistics. The constituencies are used for selecting [[politician|politicians]] who will represent them in [[Althing|parliament]]. Lastly, the municipalities give services to the people that live there. These services include [[education]], [[waste management]], [[Public transport|public transportation]], and so on.  Before 2003, the constituencies were the same as regions, but this was changed because it meant that a vote in Reykjavik meant less than one in a rural area. Even though this was addressed, the problem still exists.<ref name="CIA Govt">{{cite web |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency |title=Iceland |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |work=[[The World Factbook]] |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ic.html |accessdate=6 August 2006 }}</ref>  <center> <gallery mode="packed"> Regions of Iceland.png|[[Regions of Iceland]] Constituencies Iceland.png|[[Constituencies of Iceland]] Sveitarflg-landsvi.png|[[Municipalities of Iceland]] </gallery> </center>  ==Economy==  Fishing and fish processing is the main economic activity in Iceland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fisheries.is/economy/fisheries-impacts/employment/|title=Iceland economy|accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref> Despite effort to diversify, particularly into the travel industry, seafood exports continue to account for nearly three-quarters of merchandise exports and approximately half of all foreign exchange earnings.  Geothermal Energy produces the vast majority of Electrical Power consumed on Iceland, due chiefly to the island's position atop the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and exhibits plentiful hot water reservoirs and geysers. This has the effect of drastically reducing the price of electricity in Iceland, and has attracted several energy-intensive industries.  Aluminum Smelting (The reduction of Aluminum ores to Aluminum metal) is the largest energy-intensive manufacturing sector in Iceland, and the country produced over 800,000 Metric Tonnes per Year in 2013,<ref>{{cite web|title=Aluminium overtakes fish in Iceland|url=http://www.nordregio.se/en/Metameny/About-Nordregio/Journal-of-Nordregio/Journal-of-Nordregio-no-2-2011/Aluminium-overtakes-fish-in-Iceland/|publisher=Nordregio website|accessdate=10 August 2014|author=Hjalti Jhannesson|archive-date=30 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330195258/http://www.nordregio.se/en/Metameny/About-Nordregio/Journal-of-Nordregio/Journal-of-Nordregio-no-2-2011/Aluminium-overtakes-fish-in-Iceland/|url-status=dead}}</ref> making it the 10th largest producer of Aluminum metal worldwide.  == Geography == [[File:Icelandic landscapes.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Three types of landscapes in Iceland.]] Iceland is very geologically active and combined with large amounts of rain and snow caused by the warm waters of the gulf stream current which flow toward it, many interesting and unusual geographic features have developed which make it different from any other island so close to the [[Arctic Circle]].  Some of these features are Iceland's numerous mountains, [[volcano]]es, hot springs, rivers, small lakes, waterfalls, glaciers, and geysers. The word geyser is, in fact, derived from [[Geysir]], the name of a particularly famous geyser on the southern side of the island. Glaciers cover approximately 11% of the island and the largest, [[Vatnajkull]], is up to 1&nbsp;km thick and, by far, the largest glacier in Europe.  Iceland, though considered to be a European country, sits partly in North America since it straddles the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and North American [[tectonic plate]]s. The ridge runs directly through the populated [[Reykjavik]] and Thingvellir historic areas, and the tectonic activity of these plates separating is the source of the abundant geothermal energy in the region.  == Towns and cities == {{main|List of settlements in Iceland}} [[File:CentralReykjavk&harbour.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Reykjavik.]] [[Reykjavk]] is the [[capital (city)|capital]] [[city]] of Iceland. Reykjavk is also the most important port in Iceland.  Other important towns in Iceland are [[Akureyri]], [[Kpavogur]], [[Hafnarfjrur]], [[Keflavk]], [[Seyisfjrur]] and [[Vestmannaeyjar]].  == People == The people in Iceland are mostly of [[Scandinavia]]n origin.  The language they speak is [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. The language has not changed much in 1,000 years, so Icelanders are still able to read the [[saga]]s about the Vikings without many problems. Most people in Iceland are [[Christian]]. Most of them are [[Lutheran]].  Icelandic people are considered to be the happiest people on [[Earth]].<ref name="TGIL"/> Iceland has the highest birth rate in Europe, highest divorce rate and the highest percentage of women working outside their home.<ref name="TGIL">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/18/iceland|title=No wonder Iceland has the happiest people on earth|publisher=The Guardian.com|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}</ref>  === Names === There are no real [[surname]]s on Iceland. Children get the first name of their father (sometimes mother) with -s+son if it's a boy, and -s+dttir if it's a girl. For example, a man named Jn Stefnsson has a son named Fjalar. Fjalar's last name will not be Stefnsson like his father's, it will become Fjalar Jnsson. The same goes for women. Jn Stefnsson's daughter Kata would not have the last name Stefnsson, she would have the name Jnsdttir.  In most countries people use to call other people by their surname, but in Iceland people call other people by their first name. So when people talk about [[Halldr sgrmsson]] they do not call him sgrmsson, but Halldr.  ==Notes== {{notelist}}  == References == {{reflist}}  == Other websites == {{Sister project links|voy = Iceland|wikt=Iceland|commonscat=Category:Iceland|b=no|n=no|v=no}} * {{CIA World Factbook link|ic|Iceland}} * {{Dmoz|Regional/Europe/Iceland}} * {{Wikiatlas|Iceland}}  {{Authority control}} {{Coord|65|N|18|W|scale:5000000_source:GNS|display = title}}  {{Europe}} {{North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)}}  [[Category:Iceland| ]] [[Category:European Union candidate states]] [[Category:Nordic countries]] [[Category:1944 establishments in Europe]]</text>
