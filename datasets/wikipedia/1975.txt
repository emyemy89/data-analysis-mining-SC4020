It has 7,641 islands. [[Spain]] (1521-1898) and the [[United States]] (1898-1946), colonized (controlled) the country and [[Palau]], which is on the eastern side of the [[Philippine Sea]]. The capital city of the Philippines is [[Manila]].  The Philippines and [[East Timor]] are the only nations in East Asia where most people are [[Christianity|Christians]]. The Philippines achieved independence after the United States left in 1946.  The Philippine Islands are surrounded on the east by the [[Philippine Sea]], on the west by the [[South China Sea]], and on the south by the [[Celebes Sea]]. [[Borneo]] island is a few hundred kilometers to the southwest, [[Vietnam]] is to the west, and [[Taiwan]] is directly north.  == History == The earliest known hominin fossils from the Philippines are from ''[[Homo luzonensis]]'', an extinct species of archaic humans in the genus ''Homo''. They are are about 67,000 years old.  Human fossils have been found proving that modern ''Homo sapiens'' settled in the Philippines for thousands of years. The [[Negrito]]s crossed prehistoric land or ice to settle in the islands' land. Many groups of [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] people began to come to the Philippines in the first millennium, pushing the aboriginal population into the interior or perhaps absorbing them through intermarriage.  [[China|Chinese]] merchants arrived in the [[8th century]]. The rise of powerful [[Buddhist]] kingdoms enabled trade with the Indonesian archipelago, [[India]], [[Japan]] and Southeast Asia. Factional fighting among the kingdoms of Southeast Asia weakened their strength. In the meantime, the spread of [[Islam]] through commerce and proselytism, much like [[Christianity]], brought traders and missionaries into the region; Arabs set foot in Mindanao in the [[14th century]]. When the first [[Europe]]ans arrived, led by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in 1521, there were [[raja]]hs as far north as [[Manila]], who historically were tributaries of the kingdoms of Southeast Asia. However, the islands were essentially self-sufficient and self-ruling.  The [[Spain|Spanish]] led by [[Conquistador]] [[Miguel Lopez de Legazpi]] claimed and colonized the islands in the [[16th century]] and named it ''Filipinas'' after King [[Philip II of Spain]]. Roman [[Catholicism]] was immediately introduced. The Philippines was ruled from [[New Spain]] ([[Mexico]]) and a trade began in the 18th century began using galleons across the Pacific Ocean. Some rebellions and violence started in the towns near the ocean and during the next three centuries because of some unfairness of the government.  In 1781, Governor [[Jos Basco y Vargas]] founded the Economic Society of Friends of the Country to make the Philippines independent of New Spain.  The country opened up during the [[19th century]]. The rise of an ambitious, more nationalistic Filipino middle class and the Chinese mestizo community, signaled the end of Spanish colonialism in the islands. Enlightened by the [[Jose Rizal#Impact|Propaganda Movement]] to the injustices of the Spanish colonial government, they asked for independence. [[Jose Rizal]], the most famous propagandist, was arrested and put to death in 1896 for acts of subversion. Soon after, the [[Philippine Revolution]] broke out, led by the [[Katipunan]], a secret revolutionary society founded by [[Andres Bonifacio]] and later led by [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. The revolution nearly succeeded in ousting the Spanish by 1898.  That same year Spain and the United States fought the [[Spanish-American War]], after which Spain gave up the Philippines to the United States for US$20 million. The Filipinos had declared independence by that time and the assertion of American control led to the Philippine-American War that officially ended in 1901, but fighting continued well into 1913. Between 1899 and 1913 the American-Philippines war waged, about one million Filipinos and well over 5500 American soldiers (including missionaries and private contractors, military families) lost their lives, tens of thousands more were wounded. Most of the Philippines' casualties came from starvation, injuries, diseases, lack of clean living. Hostilities continued until 1914 when Philippines was promised future independence.  President [[William McKinley]] was killed by anarchist [[Leon Czolgosz]] because Czolgosz believed president McKinley was against good working people, he considered McKinley responsible for falsifying the reasons for the war, and approving and waging an illegal, devastating Philippines war.  The American regime imposed the [[English language]] as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' in the islands through free public education. The status of the country was turned into that of a [[Philippine Commonwealth|US commonwealth]] in 1935, which provided for more self-governance.  Independence was finally given in 1946, after [[World War II]]. The years right after that had many post-war problems. People were also not happy during the unpopular [[dictatorship]] of [[Ferdinand Marcos]], who was made to leave the presidency in 1986. Later, the continuing problem of communist insurgency and [[Moro]] separatism.  == Politics == The government of the Philippines, is similar to the Government of the United States of America. The President of the Philippines works as the head of state, the head of government, and the commander in chief of the Military of the Philippines and the armed forces. The president is elected by voting just as in America except by popular vote as there is no electoral voting. He stays as the president for 6 years. He is the leader of the cabinet.  The bicameral Philippine legislature, the Congress of the Philippines, consists of the Senate of the Philippines and the House of Representatives of the Philippines; members of both are elected by popular vote. There are 24 senators serving 6 years in the Senate while the House of Representatives consists of no more than 250 congressmen each serving 3-year terms.  The judiciary branch of the government is headed by the Supreme Court of the Philippines, which has a Chief Justice as its head and 14 Associate Justices, all appointed by the president.  The Philippines is a founding and prominent member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). It is also an active participant of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), a member of the Group of 24 and one of the 51 founding members of the United Nations on October 24, 1945.  == Regions and States == '''Local Government.''' The parts of Philippines are "local government units" (LGUs). The [[province]] is the top unit. There are 79 provinces in the country (2002). In the provinces there are [[city|cities]] and [[municipality|municipalities]] (towns). In these municipalities there are smaller ''barangays'' (villages). The ''barangay'' is the smallest local government unit.  All provinces are in 17 [[region]]s for administration (organisation). Most government offices have regional offices for the provinces. The regions do not have a separate local government, except for the Muslim Mindanao and Cordillera regions, which have their own power (autonomous government).  === Regions === {| class="wikitable" border="1" |- !

Together there are about 300,000 square kilometers of land. The islands are in three groups: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]]. Luzon is the largest island and Mindanao is the second largest. The Visayas are the group of islands in the central part of the Philippines. The busy port of Manila, on Luzon, is the country's [[Capital (city)|capital]] and it is the second-largest [[city]] after [[Quezon City]]. In the Visayas, [[Cebu City]] is the largest city. In Mindanao, [[Davao City]] is the largest city.  The [[climate]] is hot, humid (there is a lot of water in the air), and [[tropical]]. The average temperature all year is around 26.5&nbsp;Celsius. Filipinos usually say there are three [[season]]s: ''Tag-init'' or ''Tag-araw'' (the hot season or summer from March to May), ''Tag-ulan'' (the rainy season from June to November), and ''Tag-lamig'' (the cold season from December to February).  The Philippines is in the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] (zone of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions). Most of the mountainous islands had a lot of tropical [[rainforest]]s a long time ago. They started as [[volcano]]es. The highest place is [[Mount Apo]] on Mindanao at 2,954 m. Many volcanoes in the country, for example [[Mount Mayon]], are active. The country also has about 19 [[typhoon]]s per year.  Taal Volcano is an island in Taal Lake. It is in an ancient caldera in Batangas Province. It is about 2 hours by bus going south from Manila. The jump-off point in Talisay is suitable for day trips and overnighters.  == Problems == There are many environmental problems in the Philippines. One of them is [[overfishing]] in many areas, which lead to pitiful catches. Another problem is that only ten percent of sewage is treated and cleaned, while the other 90% is dumped back to nature and the ocean, which leads to [[pollution]]. [[Deforestation]] is a serious problem, and after decades of cutting down forests, illegal logging and forest fires, there is only 3% left of original forest cover. Forest losses have also affected the Philippines with serious [[soil erosion]], which is threatening the Philippines [[biodiversity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_offices/philippines/|title=WWF Philippines office - WWF|website=wwf.panda.org}}</ref>  == Economy == The Philippines is a developing country. In 1998 the Philippine economy  a mixture of [[agriculture]], light industry, and support services  deteriorated because of the effects of the [[Asian financial crisis]] and poor weather conditions. The economy's growth fell to 0.6% in 1998 from 5% in 1997, but recovered to about 3% in 1999 and 4% in 2000. As of 2012, it's estimated at 6.6%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2013/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2011&ey=2018&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=566&s=NGDPD,NGDPDPC,PPPGDP,PPPPC&grp=0&a=&pr.x=80&pr.y=15|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|website=www.imf.org}}</ref>  The government has promised to continue its economic reforms to help the Philippines match the pace of development in the newly industrialized countries of [[Southeast Asia]]. The strategies are improving [[infrastructure]], fixing the [[tax]] system to help the government income, supporting deregulation (to remove government control) and [[privatization]] of the economy, and increasing trade within the region. Future prospects depend heavily on the economic performance of the three major trading partners, [[China]], the [[United States]] and [[Japan]].  == People == Around 94 million people live in the Philippines as of 2010. Most people in the Philippines are of [[Malay race|Austronesian]] stock. The ethnic [[China|Chinese]], who have helped run businesses since the [[9th century]], also live in the country. Its now 105 million people there. The [[Negrito]]s live in the mountains of Luzon and Visayas. Luzon has a lot of [[mestizo]] people, a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term for someone of mixed Hispanic and native blood.  The people of the Philippines are known as ''[[Filipinos]]''. Filipinos are divided into many groups, the three largest are the Tagalogs, Cebuanos, and the Ilocanos. When the Philippines was a colony, the term "Filipino" used to mean the Spanish and Spanish-[[mixed]] minority. But now everyone who is a citizen/national of the Philippines is called "Filipino". Even then, it is still has the most diverse [[ethnic group]]s in Asia, the other being [[Indonesia]]. People also call [[Filipinos]] "[[Filipinos|Pinoy]]" for short.  == Languages == [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and [[English language|English]] are the official languages. Filipino is based largely on Tagalog, a native language spoken in Metro Manila and neighboring provinces. The Filipino language, is a cousin of the [[Malay language]]. Other local languages and dialects are [[Cebuano]] and [[Ilocano]] and many others. English is used in government, schools and business. Other languages are [[Chinese language|Chinese]] which is spoken by the ethnic Chinese population and the Chinese-Filipinos. Most of the [[Muslims]] living deep in southern [[Mindanao]] and the smaller islands off of the southern Philippine mainland near [[Malaysia|Malaysia's]] northeastern tip. They also speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as a second language but to a very small extent. [[Spanish language|Spanish]], once the official language of the Philippines in the 1970s is also spoken by a notable minority of Filipinos.  == Culture == Before the Spanish arrived, the Filipinos did not think of themselves as one culture. Most of the Philippines were Buddhist, Muslim and Hindu empires. The Spaniards came in 1565, and brought with them [[Spanish culture]]. They soon spread to the islands making forts and schools, preaching Christianity, and converting most of the native people to the [[Catholic]] religion. When the United States colonized the islands in 1898, the [[Americans]] brought with them their own culture, which has the strongest influence up to now. This makes the Philippines the most Westernized country in eastern Asia. The Spanish culture in the Philippines though, is not directly from Spain but from [[Mexico]], since the Philippines was ruled by [[Spain]], through [[Mexico]]. It was governed from [[Mexico City]] which explains much of the [[Spain|Spanish]] influence in the Philippines that one could only find in [[Mexico]] and not in [[Spain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philippine-history.org/spanish-colonial-masters.htm|title=The Spaniards as Colonial Masters in the Philippines|website=www.philippine-history.org}}</ref> Also, the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] that was spoken in the Philippines was Mexican [[Spanish language|Spanish]], not European [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. A lot of the foods in the Philippines can also be found in [[Mexico]]. Filipinos, as a tradition, usually eat with hands, like that of [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] tradition. And most of Filipino cuisine is also of [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] influence for the most part.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.myfilipinokitchen.com/history-of-filipino-food-malay-influence/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-02-18 |archive-date=2012-02-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203011939/http://www.myfilipinokitchen.com/history-of-filipino-food-malay-influence/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Each year major festivities called ''barrio fiestas'' are held. They commemorate the Patron saints of the towns, villages and regional districts. The festivities includes church services, street parades, fireworks displays, feasts, dance/music contests, and cockfights.  == Religion == Most of the people in the Philippines are [[Christianity|Christians]]. About 92% of the people are Christians. Most people in the Philippines belong to the [[Roman Catholic]] faith (70%). A sizable percentage of the people are [[Protestantism|Protestants]] (many diverse Christian denominations) (17%), Iglesia ni Cristo (2%), [[Islam|Muslims]] (5-10%), [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (2%). There are also some [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and some other minor religions with fewer adherents (6.6%).  ==Related pages== *[[List of rivers of the Philippines]] *[[Philippines at the Olympics]] *[[Philippines national football team]]  == References == {{Reflist}} * [http://www.dmoz.org/Regional/Asia/Philippines/ Open Directory Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040819050600/http://dmoz.org/Regional/Asia/Philippines/ |date=2004-08-19 }}  == Other websites == * [http://www.gov.ph Government Portal] * [http://www.op.gov.ph Office of the President] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609185330/http://www.op.gov.ph/ |date=2007-06-09 }} * [http://www.senate.gov.ph Senate of the Philippines] * [http://www.congress.gov.ph House of Representatives] * [http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph Supreme Court of the Philippines] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512084154/http://www.supremecourt.gov.ph/ |date=2008-05-12 }}  {{Asia}} {{ASEAN}}  [[Category:Philippines| ]] [[Category:1946 establishments in Asia]]</text>
