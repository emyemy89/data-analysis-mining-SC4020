<title>Socialism</title><text>[[File:New Harmony, Indiana, por F. Bates.jpg|thumb|New Harmony, a model community presented by Robert Owen, 1838]]  '''Socialism''' is an [[economics|economic]] and [[Politics|political]] system. It is an economic theory of social organization. It states that the means of making, moving, and trading wealth should be owned or controlled by the workers. This means the money made belongs to the workers who make the products, instead of groups of private owners. People who agree with this type of system are called socialists.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Durlauf|first1=Steven N.|last2=E.

"Socialism".'' New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd ed.</ref>  == Forms of socialism == There are many kinds of socialism. In all types, at least in principle, ''the workers own the means of production''.<ref> Lamb, Peter & J.C. Docherty. 2006. ''Historical dictionary of socialism''. Lanham, Maryland, UK; Oxford, England, UK: Scarecrow Press. p. 1.</ref> The major differences between the different varieties are the role of the [[free market]] (market planning), how the means of production are controlled, the role of management of workers, and the government's role in the economy.    === Collectivization === Another kind of socialism is "[[collectivization]]." In this system, money and goods are shared more equally among the people, with the government in control. In theory, this system results in the gap between classes getting smaller, with the state helping the nation's poorest people, while the richest agree to higher taxes and economic restrictions.   === Communism as a goal === Some socialists believe that socialism will evolve into what they see as a more advanced system: [[communism]], with no [[state]], [[money]], or social classes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} In [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, socialism is a temporary social state between [[capitalism]] and [[communism]], although some socialists have no intention of transitioning to communism.{{fact|date=August 2019}}  Many label these economic theories into one as "communism" when they mean the [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[Leninism|Leninist]] ideas and beliefs of [[Russia]]'s [[Bolshevik]] party. [[Karl Marx|Marx]] believed that capitalism followed the economic and political system of [[feudalism]]. He also believed that capitalism would unfairly treat many people and that those people would eventually revolt and switch to socialism. He also thought that socialism could be another bridge on a path to communism. However, many people incorrectly use the term "Communist" to refer to a socialist state as a pejorative insult. Others call this 'State Socialism,' to distinguish it from the communist goal that does not need a state or any form of government. To non-communists, the word 'socialism' is now used mostly for attempts to come close to this goal in a democratic state.  === Democratic socialism === [[Democratic socialism]] is a belief that both the economy and society should be run democraticallyto meet public needs, not to make profits for a few. To achieve a more just society, many structures of our government and economy must be radically transformed through greater economic and social democracy so that ordinary people can participate in the many decisions that affect their lives.  === Social democracy === [[Social democracy]] is a kind of capitalism that tries to mix parts of socialism with [[capitalism]]. It is not a form of socialism, but shares some ideas with it. In this system, despite there still being [[private property]], the government takes money from the rich and gives it to the poor to reduce inequality, usually in the form of social programs. While the intentions of social democracy and socialism can be similar or shared, social democracy keeps the capitalist system intact, and slightly reforms it. Socialism would mean completely getting rid of the capitalist system. Social democracy is often confused with democratic socialism due to the similar names and having the same short term goals. The biggest difference is social democrats want to stop reforming capitalism when they think their reforms are good enough, but democratic socialists will not stop until capitalism is gone. Some examples of social democracies are the Scandinavian countries.  In social democracies, some services and industries are [[subsidized]] (given money to help them run), or partly controlled by the [[government]], or both. For example, [[education]], [[National Health Service|health care]], [[House|housing]], utility companies and [[public transportation]] are some industries that might be owned/supported by the government in a social democracy. For the most part, people working in these industries are paid by the government, with money paid by the people as taxes. A strong [[Welfare]] system is key to social democracy.  === Other === Many people and countries see socialism differently. The [[Socialist International]] is an organization dedicated to the cause of promoting socialist ideals, and has ties with many socialist parties, especially Social Democratic parties.  == History == The followers of a [[Wales|Welshman]], [[Robert Owen]], began calling themselves socialists in 1841.<ref name=gale>Gale (2001). "Socialism" . World of Sociology. Retrieved 15 June 2011.</ref> Owen is seen as a founder of the [[Co-op]]erative Movement in Britain. He said that workers should own the companies they worked for. The workers would then share the [[profit]]s among themselves. He set up a new model factory in New Lanark, Scotland.<ref name=wt>{{cite web |url= http://www.credoreference.com/entry/sharpewt/socialism |title=Socialism |first= |last= |work=Encyclopedia of World Trade From Ancient Times to the Present |year=2005 |accessdate=15 June 2011}}</ref>   Karl Marx is the most well-known creator of the theory of socialism, and of communism. He wrote a book about capitalism, socialism, and communism, called "[[Das Kapital|A critique of the social economy]]". Friedrich Engels co-wrote the book, and paid for much of Marx's work and research.   Many socialist [[political party|political parties]] were formed during the 19th century and early part of the 20th century. During the [[decolonization]] movement in the 20th century, many [[armies]] fighting for [[independence]] planned to establish socialist countries.  ==Related pages== * [[Capitalism]] * [[Communism]] * [[Social democracy]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  [[Category:Forms of government]] [[Category:Socialism| ]]</text>
