<title>Foot</title><text>:''Foot is also the name of a unit of measurement. See [[foot (unit)]].  [[File:Human male foot.jpg|thumb|200px|A man's right foot]] [[File:WomanFeet.png|thumb|200px|A woman's right foot]] [[File:Blausen 0411 FootAnatomy.png|thumb|170px|Bones in lower leg and foot]]  A '''foot''' (one ''foot'', two or more '''feet''') is a [[body]] part on the end of a [[leg]]. It is used when walking. It is also important for balance: it helps people stand straight. People also use it to [[kick]], in both [[fighting]] and [[sport]]s, [[football]] being an example.  People's hands and feet have the same shape: they both have five ''digits'' (the fingers and toes). Many other [[Vertebrate|animals with backbones]] also have five digits. The part of the foot which joins it to the leg is called the ''heel''. The bottom of the foot is called the ''sole''.   Most land [[vertebrate]]<nowiki/>s have feet, and there are many different sorts of foot. The feet of [[monkey]]s are much like the hands. The hard foot of an [[ungulate]] is a [[hoof]]. When an animal has soft feet, or feet with soft parts on the underside, we often call it a ''[[paw]]''. Many invertebrates also have feet.  Many people like to use [[footwear]], especially outside.  It has special names, for example ''sandals'', ''[[shoe]]s'', and ''[[boot]]s''.  When people always wear footwear, especially in hot places or when they are very active, their feet can smell badly (''foot odour)''.  Wearing footwear that is too big or small can be bad for the feet.  People who have foot, leg, and back problems can also get help from special shoes.   People have different traditions in different parts of the world for when to wear footwear.  For example, in many countries, usually do not wear their shoes or boots in a home.  In the United States people often wear shoes inside a home.  In Japan, people do not wear shoes in homes, and floors are often made of very soft materials, too soft for shoes.  In cultures where people always wear shoes, people sometimes think it is bad not to wear them.  Not wearing shoes can be good for the feet, especially for children's feet.  Conditions like [[Athlete's foot]] affect the feet, causing the feet to feel dry and cracked.  Doctors who work with people's feet are ''podiatrists'' or ''chiropodists''.  == Bones == Half the bones in a human body are in the foot.  There are 26 [[bone]]s there.  They are 14 [[phalanges]] ([[toes]]), 5 [[metatarsals]] (arch of the foot), and 7 [[tarsals]] ([[ankle]] bones).  {{Commons category|Feet}}   [[Category:Basic English 850 words]] [[Category:Feet| ]]</text>
