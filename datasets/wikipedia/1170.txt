Guns made of wood or bamboo are thought to have been invented in [[China]] around 1000 AD. In the next few centuries they spread to other parts of Asia and to Europe where they were made of [[metal]]. Guns largely replaced [[catapult]]s and [[Archery|bows and arrows]] when they became strong enough to reach out over longer distances to kill. They are of many different sizes. Some are small enough to hold in one hand. Others are large enough to sink a [[warship]].  In [[military]] jargon, the word "firearm" is used for the type of weapons that soldiers carry. Most are either [[pistol]]s or [[rifle]]s.  Guns that are small enough to be carried and used by one person have the same basic parts: a [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]], a [[barrel (weapons)|barrel]], and a handgrip or [[stock (firearm)|stock]].  The trigger is pulled by a [[finger]] to [[Gunshot|fire]] the weapon which releases a bullet. The barrel guides the bullet which then flies to the [[Bullseye (sports)|target]].  The handgrip is held by the shooter's hand.  Guns can be very effective [[weapon]]s. Their bullets fly faster than an [[arrow]] or [[spear]].  Their high [[kinetic energy]] makes them more deadly.  They also shoot greater distances.  Bullets are usually non-explosive pieces of metal.  == Cartridges == A modern bullet is the front part of a ''round'' or [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]. A cartridge consists of a ''bullet'', [[propellant]] and a [[primer (firearm)|primer]]. These are packaged in a [[metal]]lic, [[paper]], or [[plastic]] case which is sized exactly for the [[chamber (firearms)|chamber]] of the firearm being used. When the rear of the case (containing the primer) is struck, an explosion in the back of the cartridge ignites the propellant. The controlled explosion forces the bullet out of the barrel. Cartridges have different ways of being loaded into different kinds of weapons. Cartridges can be loaded directly into a firearm into the chamber. Or, more commonly, into a '''clip''', a [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]] or other bullet container which is loaded into the firearm. Handguns known as [[revolver]]s have a [[cylinder]] with holes that the bullets are loaded into. Modern guns called [[pistol]]s are handguns loaded with a magazine.  == Military use == [[File:AK-47 type II Part DM-ST-89-01131.jpg|thumb|left|200px|{{Center|[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] AK-47 a widely used military [[assault rifle]]}}]] Guns have been used by armies since about the [[14th century]]. Long barreled guns called [[musket]]s, that could be carried and used by one person, were in use by 1350.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nramuseum.com/gun-info-research/a-brief-history-of-firearms.aspx|title=A Brief History of Firearms|website=|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2016|author=Jim Supica}}</ref>  They became an important weapon in [[Europe]]an armies about the 1600s.   Modern militaries use the word "gun" for larger [[artillery]] guns that need several people, and that fire big ammunition. For example, weapons on [[warship]]s and [[tank]]s are called "guns". They may be in a "turret" (a rotating base). Big guns usually fire [[Shell (projectile)|artillery shells]], which explode upon impact.   In almost every country firearms are the main weapons used by armies. In modern armies, every [[soldier]] has at least one firearm as standard equipment. Soldiers are [[training|trained]] to use firearms, and to keep them clean and ready for use.   == Sporting use == [[File:Modern Hunting Rifle.jpg|thumb|250px|right|{{center|A hunting rifle, such as this one, is designed to kill animals rather than people}}]]   Shooting is a competitive sport involving tests of accuracy and speed. They use various types of guns such as pistols, revolvers, rifles, shotguns and [[air gun|airgun]]s. Shooting sports are categorized by the type of firearm, targets, and distances at which the targets are shot. Target Shooting is an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport.   Since the first [[human]]s, hunting became a way of life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://americanshootingjournal.com/the-evolution-of-hunting-a-brief-history-of-tools-weapons-tactics-roles-and-purpose/ |title=The Evolution of Hunting: History of Tools, Weapons, Tactics, Roles and Purpose |author= |website= |publisher=American Shooting Journal |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref> It was and still is in some places, the key to [[wikt:survival|survival]].

But many [[Hunter-gatherer|subsistence hunters]] have adapted to use modern firearms. In modern countries hunting is still allowed but is considered a sport. Hunting can be used to control the populations of many animal species. As with many aspects of gun ownership and use, modern hunting remains controversial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-talks-hunting/ |title=Does Hunting Help or Hurt the Environment? |author= |date=10 November 2009 |website= |publisher=Scientific American |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref> Handguns are not generally used for hunting.  == Legal use == Guns can be used to kill other people. For that reason many [[country|countries]] only allow [[soldier]]s, [[police]]men, and certain [[social class]]es to have them. In some countries, a person must have a special [[permit]] (or license) if they want to own a gun.  Depending on the gun, people need to be a certain age and may need to meet other [[wikt:criteria|criteria]] to get such a permit.   An example of this is that in the [[United States]] [[Law of the United States|federal law]] allows buying rifles and/or shotguns at age 18if purchased from a licensed firearms dealer.<ref name="LawCent">{{cite web |url=http://smartgunlaws.org/minimum-age-to-purchase-possess-firearms-policy-summary/ |title= Minimum Age to Purchase & Possess Firearms Policy Summary |author= |date=1 October 2013 |website= |publisher=Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence |accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref>  But a person must be age 21 or older to purchase a handgunfrom a licensed firearms dealer.<ref name="LawCent" /> However, if purchased from an unlicensed person, with few [[wikt:exception|exception]]s, a handgun may not be sold to anyone under age 18.<ref name="LawCent" /> There is no age restriction on who may buy a rifle or shotgun from an unlicensed person.<ref name="LawCent" /> In the United States and other countries, people can buy guns for [[self-defense]], [[hunting]], and [[shooting sport]]s like target shooting.   In some countries, such as [[Australia]], people who live on farms are allowed to keep guns, but it is not easy for a person living in the city to get a gun without good reason. In the [[United Kingdom]], access by the general public to firearms is tightly controlled by law. However, this is less restrictive in [[Northern Ireland]].
