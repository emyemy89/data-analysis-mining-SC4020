[[Bill Gates]] and [[Paul Allen]] founded the company in 1975.<ref name="bbc-timeline">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5085630.stm|title=Bill Gates: A timeline|work=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2006-06-15|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> Microsoft makes [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Microsoft Office]] (including [[Microsoft Word]]), [[Microsoft Edge|Edge]], [[MSN]] and [[Xbox]], among others. Most Microsoft [[computer program|programs]] cannot be [[download]]ed for free - people have to buy them in a shop or online. Some products (like the [[Windows]] [[operating system]]) are often already installed when people buy a new [[computer]].  == Software == *[[Microsoft Windows]] is an [[operating system]], which means that it is the basic software that makes people's computers work and lets other programs work.  The majority of desktop and [[laptop]] computers run Windows, and so do some [[tablet computer]]s and a few [[smartphone]]s. The latest version of Windows is [[Windows 10]]. The latest server version is [[Windows Server 2019]]. *[[Microsoft Office]] is an [[office suite]].  It lets people write documents on their computer with [[Microsoft Word]], make charts and graphs with [[Microsoft Excel]], make presentations with [[Microsoft PowerPoint]], and send email with [[Microsoft Outlook]]. [[Microsoft Sharepoint]] is a server tool included in Microsoft Office (2007, 2013). Microsoft Expression series was a web development tool. *[[Internet Explorer]] is a piece of software that lets people look at things online (known as [[web browser|browsing]]) and download things from the [[Internet]]. In 2015, it was replaced by [[Microsoft Edge]]. *Microsoft also makes other programs for the Internet.  Many of them are called [[Windows Live]] services, with the name Windows Live put in front of the old name of the service, like Windows Live [[Hotmail]].  After 2012, the Windows Live name was less used. * Microsoft [[Bing]] is an internet [[search engine]] for finding things online.  Bing Maps shows [[map]]<nowiki/>s. * [[MS-DOS]] is the first existing operating system developed by Microsoft, used for primitive computers and terminals. * [[Minecraft]] and many other programs have been bought by Microsoft and developed further.  == Services == Although Microsoft is best known for its software products, the company also runs a number of [[web services]]. They include: *[[Outlook.com]] is a [[webmail]] service. When Microsoft created this service in 1996, it was called [[Hotmail]]. It is used to send and receive [[email]], manage a [[calendar]] of events and tasks, and a list of contacts (such as [[phone number]]s and [[email address]]es). *[[OneDrive]] is a [[file hosting service]]. It was started in 2007 and was called "SkyDrive" at the time. Users can upload files to a [[web server]] and get them on a variety of devices, including PCs and [[mobile device]]s. *[[Skype]] is a [[Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]] and [[social media]] service. It was not created by Microsoft, but by a company called Skype SARL, which was later bought out by Microsoft. The Skype program or [[mobile app]] lets people make [[phone call]]s through the Internet to other Skype users for free and, for a fee, [[landline]] phones.  *[[LinkedIn]] is a [[social networking service]] for people with professional [[job]]s. Like Skype, it was not created by Microsoft but by another company which Microsoft later bought. The site lets people post information about their jobs and skills to help [[employer]]s look for new people to [[wikt:hire|hire]]. *[[MSN]] is a [[web portal]] where people can read [[news]] and get information about different topics. It was created in 1995 and at one point its services were made under the [[brand]] name of "Windows Live". MSN used to have an [[instant messaging]] service, MSN Messenger, but that has since become part of Skype. *[[Bing]] is a [[search engine]] similar to [[Google]]. It used to be under the MSN brand and was later known as Live Search, but became its own service in 2009. Bing is known for the different images that appear on the background of its home page.  == Hardware == Microsoft has also made a wide variety of [[Computer hardware|hardware]] over the years. Among them are computer accessories like [[Computer mouse|mice]], [[computer keyboard|keyboards]], and [[webcam]]s.  The company also makes and promotes a [[video game console]], [[Xbox]]. It lets people play video games on their [[television]]s. The games were first stored on [[Compact disc|CD]]s, but many recent games are downloaded from the Internet. There have been three generations of Xbox. The first generation came out in 2001 and was just called Xbox, while the second, the [[Xbox 360]], was released in 2005. The third and newest model is the [[Xbox One]] in May 2013. Beginning with the Xbox 360, Microsoft introduced [[Xbox Live]], which lets people play games online against other people anywhere in the world. The Xbox has become very popular and more than 100 million units have been sold worldwide. Because of this, Microsoft is considered one of the three big companies that make video game consoles, along with [[Nintendo]] and [[Sony]].  Most recently, Microsoft has also started to make its own [[personal computer|PC]]s, called the [[Microsoft Surface|Surface]]. The first model was announced in 2012 and the Surface line now includes [[tablet computer|tablets]] that use either [[ARM architecture|ARM]] or [[Intel]] processors, two models of [[laptop]]s called the Surface Book and Surface Laptop, an [[all-in-one PC]] called the Surface Studio, and an interactive whiteboard, the Surface Hub.  In 2014, Microsoft bought the [[mobile phone]] division of [[Nokia]], a [[Finland|Finnish]] company, which then became [[Microsoft Mobile]]. The sale included the [[Microsoft Lumia|Lumia]] family of [[smartphone]]s, which use Microsoft's own Windows Phone platform. From 2014 to 2016, Microsoft Mobile also made [[feature phone]]s with the Nokia brand. Then the feature phone business was sold to [[HMD global]], which continues to produce  both feature phones and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] smartphones under license from Nokia.  ==References== {{reflist}}  == Other websites == * [http://www.microsoft.com/ Main Microsoft Website]  [[Category:1975 establishments in the United States]] [[Category:Bill Gates]] [[Category:Microsoft| ]]</text>
