It has many ''[[kami]]'', translated as [[Deity|gods]] or nature [[spirit]]s. Some "kami" are just spirits of certain places, and some are the overall "kami" (like "Amaterasu", the [[Sun]] goddess). The word "Shinto" comes from the Japanese words "{{lang|ja|}}", ''shin''the word for [[spirit]] or [[Deity|god]], and "{{lang|ja|}}", ''t''the word for "the way" or "path". So, Shinto means "the way of the gods."   State Shinto was the main religion of Japan before [[World War II]]. During the period 1868 to 1945 the Japanese government used Shinto for [[propaganda]]. All Japanese were forced to register with their local shrine. All Shinto priests worked for the government. [[War]] was seen as a sacred duty. The [[Emperor of Japan]] was seen as a god. Japanese [[Buddhism]] was also involved with the war effort (See [[Zen at War]]).  Shinto has many [[ritual]]s and [[custom]]s, and some are done every day. Festivals are frequent. Some people mix Shinto and Buddhist rituals and beliefs.   * Although [[Jinja-Honcho]] manages almost all shrines, some, such as [[Yasukuni]], are run separately.  * [[Amaterasu]], the Sun Goddess, is seen as the holiest of all Shinto kami. [[Ise Shrine|Her shrine]] is in [[Ise]], [[Japan]].  == Other page == *[[Shinto shrine]]  == Other websites == * [http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/ Kokugakuin University Encylopedia of Shinto]  {{Commonscat|Shint|Shinto}}  {{Classic World Religions}}   {{multistub|religion|Japan}}  [[Category:Shinto| ]] <!-- interwiki --></text>
