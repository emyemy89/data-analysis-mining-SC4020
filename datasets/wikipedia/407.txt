Planets are smaller than stars, and they do not produce [[light]]. Jupiter is the biggest planet in the [[Solar System]].   Planets are shaped like a slightly squashed ball (called a [[spheroid]]). Objects that orbit planets are called [[Satellite (natural)|satellites]]. A star and everything which orbits it are called a [[star system]].   There are eight planets in the Solar System. [[Pluto]] used to be called a planet, but in August 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] decided it was a [[dwarf planet]] instead. There are four more known dwarf planets in the Solar System, [[1 Ceres|Ceres]], [[Makemake (dwarf planet)|Makemake]], [[136199 Eris|Eris]] and [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]].  The name "planet" is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word '''' (''planetes''), meaning "wanderers", or "things that move". Until the 1990s, people only knew of those in the Solar System.  As of June 2017, we know of 3,610 other planets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jean Schneider|title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog|url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php|work=The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-06-23}}</ref>  These newly found planets are orbiting other stars: they are [[Extrasolar planet|''extrasolar'' planets]]. Sometimes people call them "exoplanets".</onlyinclude>  == Origin of the planets == The planets are composed of material quite different from the Sun.<ref>Charles H. Lineweaver 2001.

[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ConPh..51..381W]</ref> The Sun is almost entirely composed of [[hydrogen]], and some [[helium]]. Its energy comes from the conversion of hydrogen to helium. In contrast, the "terrestrial" planets are composed almost entirely of larger atoms and molecules which ''cannot'' have come from the Sun. It follows, therefore, that the material which forms those planets must have come from another source or sources. Those sources were the atoms formed in [[supernovae]] explosions by much larger and much shorter-lived stars in the Sun's neighbourhood as it moved in the [[galaxy]]. This material was captured by the Sun's [[gravity]] and pulled along to become the basic material out of which the planets condensed. The same considerations apply to other planetary systems in the galaxy.<ref>Safronov, Viktor Sergeevich 1972. Evolution of the protoplanetary cloud and formation of the Earth and the planets. ''Israel Program for Scientific Translations''. ISBN 0-7065-1225-1</ref>  The [[gas giants]] are composed of hydrogen gas from the same source as the Sun, plus (at their centres) higher "metallic" elements like the terrestrial planets. This is known from the drive-by data gathered by satellites, and by drive-into probes like the [[Galileo (spacecraft)]]. There is a huge amount of data collected about each planet. The data is stored on computer files, and there are summary volumes in print.  == In the Solar System == {{Main|History of astronomy}} [[File:Planets2008.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Planets of the [[Solar System]]]]  The planets in the Solar System have names of [[Greek mythology|Greek]] or [[Roman mythology|Roman]] gods, apart from Earth, because people did not think Earth was a planet in old times. However, Earth is occasionally referred by the name of a Roman god: ''Terra''. Other languages, for example [[Chinese language|Chinese]], use different names. Moons also have names of gods and people from classical [[myth]]ology. The names of the moons of Uranus are from the [[theatre|plays]] written by [[Shakespeare]].   === Planets === Here is a [[list of planets]] in the Solar System. They are ordered by how close they are to the Sun, nearest first.  {| class="wikitable " style="text-align: left;"  ! Planet !

Some examples of "minor planets" are [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[trans-Neptunian object]]s.  Planets in the Solar System are of three sorts: * [[Terrestrial planet|''Terrestrial'' or ''rocky'']]: Planets that are similar to Earth  in them is mostly [[Rock (geology)|rock]]: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars.  * [[Gas giant|''Jovian'' or ''gas giant'']]: These planets are mostly made of [[gas]]: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Uranian planets are a special sort of gas giants, they have more [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]. * [[Ice dwarf|''Icy'']]: Sometimes people also have a third sort, for bodies such as [[Pluto]] (though Pluto is no longer called a planet by everyone). These planets are mostly made of [[ice]]. Many objects in the Solar System that are not planets are also "icy". Examples are the icy moons of the outer planets of the Solar System (like [[Triton (moon)|Triton]]).  ==Related pages== * [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System]] * [[List of planets]] * [[Ice dwarf]]s  ==References== {{reflist}}   {{Solar System}}  [[Category:Planets| ]]</text>
