south-western side of [[South America]]. Most people there speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]].  Chile, which claims a part of the [[Antarctica|Antarctic continent]], is the longest country on earth. The [[Atacama Desert]], in the north of the country, is the driest place on earth. The average rainfall there is less than {{cvt|0.05|mm}} per year. The center of Chile, with the two cities Santiago and Valparaso, has a [[Mediterranean climate]] with an average temperatures of {{cvt|28|C}} in January and {{cvt|11|C}} in July.  In the middle of Chile, the country is very good for growing things.  There are about 16.9 million people living in Chile in 2009. About 10 million people live in the center of Chile around Valparaso and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], on about 20% of the total land.  Chile is a well-educated country. Only 2.7% are not able to read or write. Some believe that Chile has one of the best school systems in South America.  About 95% of Chileans are people with a combination of [[Europe]]an descent, mostly [[Spanish people|Spanish]], but also [[Germans|German]], [[English people|English]], [[Italians|Italian]] and [[Arab people]]. Around 2% of the population is [[Native American]], but most people have native ancestors. [[Immigrants]] are 7% of the population. including Peruvians, Bolivians, Colombians, Haitians, Chinese and Europeans. The majority of people are [[Roman Catholic]] (62.8%), but many do not go to church. About 10% are [[Protestant]], and there are some [[Judaism|Jews]] and [[Muslims]] as well. The country's official language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. [[Chili pepper]]s, first cultivated by Native Americans from other Latin American countries and the United States, did not come from this country, although it has a similar name.  Chile's currency is the Chilean ''peso''.  ==Geography== [[File:Parinacota volcano.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|Parinacota volcano in northern Chile]] Chile borders [[Peru]] to the north, [[Bolivia]] to the northeast, [[Argentina]] to the east, and the [[Drake Passage]] in the far south. It is over {{convert|4,630|km}} north to south, but only {{convert|430|km}} at its widest point east to west.  The northern [[Atacama Desert]] has great mineral wealth, mostly [[copper]] and [[nitrate]]s. Chile is the largest producer of copper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-25/chile-s-copper-giant-codelco-to-trim-2015-refined-supply.html|title=Chiles Copper Giant Codelco to Trim 2015 Refined Supply |publisher=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> The [[Andes Mountains]] are on the eastern border.  Chile controls [[Easter Island]] and Sala y Gmez Island, the easternmost islands of [[Polynesia]].  ==Animals and plants== [[File:BeagleChannelGlacier.jpg|thumb|left|A glacier at Beagle Channel in southern Chile]] [[File:Sephanoides fernandensis.jpg|thumb|Juan Fernndez Firecrown]]  ===Animals=== Only a few of the many distinctive South American animals are found in Chile. Among the larger mammals are the [[Cougar|puma]] or cougar, the llama-like [[guanaco]] and the fox-like chilla. In the forest region, several types of [[marsupial]]s and a small deer known as the pudu are found.  There are many species of small birds, but not most of the larger common Latin American types. Few freshwater fish are from Chile, but North American trout have been successfully introduced into the Andean lakes. The coast of Chile is close to the [[Humboldt Current]], so ocean waters have many fish and other forms of marine life. This in turn supports a rich variety of waterfowl, including several penguins. There are many whales, and six species of seals in the area.  ===Fungi=== Just over 3,000 species of [[fungi]] are recorded in Chile.<ref>Oehrens, E.B. "Flora Fungosa Chilena". Universidad de Chile, Santiago de Chile, 1980</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/robigalia/eng/index.htm |title=Cybertruffle's Robigalia  Observations of fungi and their associated organisms |publisher=cybertruffle.org.uk |accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref> This number is far from complete. The true total number of fungal species in Chile is likely to be far higher. The generally accepted estimate is that only about 7 percent of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.<ref>Kirk, P.M., Cannon, P.F., Minter, D.W. and Stalpers, J. "Dictionary of the Fungi". Edn 10. CABI, 2008</ref>  ===Plants=== The northernmost coastal and central region is largely empty of vegetation. It is the most close to an absolute desert in the world. On the slopes of the Andes, besides the scattered tola desert brush, grasses are found. The central valley has several species of [[cactus|cacti]], the hardy espinos (a kind of [[acacia]] tree), the Chilean pine, the southern [[beech]]es and the copihue, a red bell-shaped flower that is Chile's national flower.  In southern Chile, south of the [[Biobo River]] lots of rain has made dense forests of laurels, magnolias, and various species of conifers and beeches, which become smaller and more stunted to the south.<ref name="Bio&Con">{{cite journal |last=Smith-Ramrez |first=Cecilia |title=Distribution patterns of flora and fauna in southern Chilean Coastal rain forests: Integrating Natural History and GIS |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |volume=16 |number=9 |date=August, 2007 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/73521g0852w08858/fulltext.pdf |accessdate=26 June 2019 |doi=10.1007/s10531-006-9073-2 }}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  The cold temperatures and winds of the extreme south make it impossible for heavy forestation.

The coat of arms shows the two national animals: the [[condor]] (''Vultur gryphus'', a very large bird that lives in the mountains) and the huemul (''Hippocamelus bisulcus,'' an endangered white tail deer). It also has the saying ''Por la razn o la fuerza'' (''By reason or by force'').  The flag of Chile has two equal horizontal bands of white (top) and red. There is a blue square the same height as the white band. The square has a white five-pointed star in the center.  The star is a guide to progress and honor. Blue is for the sky, white is for the snow-covered Andes, and red stands for the blood spilled to get independence.  == Gallery == <gallery> File:Mapa administrativo de Chile.png|Administrative Map File:Benjamn Vicua 02.jpg|Actor Benjamn Vicua File:Nicolas Massu.jpg|Tennis player Nicolas Massu File:Mara Elena Swett (Descarado, 2006).jpg|Actress Mara Elena Swett <br /> File:Manuel Pellegrini(2).jpg|Manuel Pellegrini File:PuertoVaras.jpg|Puerto Varas File:Santiago en invierno.jpg|Metropolitan Region File:Renaca4.jpg|Reaca to central Chile File:Edificios stgo.jpg|Santiago of Chile <br /> File:Valdivia.jpg|Valdivia in southern Chile File:Puerto Octay.jpg|Puerto Octay File:Lolol, near Villa Esperanza.jpg|[[Lolol]] </gallery>  ==Related pages== * [[Chile at the Olympics]] * [[Chile national football team]] * [[List of rivers of Chile]]  ==References== {{Sister project links|Chile|voy=Chile}} {{reflist}}  {{South America}}  [[Category:Chile| ]] [[Category:Spanish-speaking countries]]</text>
