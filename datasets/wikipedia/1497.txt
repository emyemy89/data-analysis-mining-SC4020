<title>Time zone</title><text>[[File:World Time Zones Map.png|thumb|400px|Standard World Time Zones map (as of August 2015)]] '''Time zones''' give specific areas on the [[Earth]] a [[time]] of [[day]] that is earlier or later than the neighboring time zones. This is because when it is daytime on one side of the earth, it is night-time on the other side. There are 24 time zones dividing the earth into different times, each with its own name, like the [[North American Eastern Time Zone]]. The North American Eastern Time Zone contains large cities in [[North America]] like [[New York City]] and [[Miami]].  [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) began in 1675. This was when the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] was built to help ships find their longitude at sea. GMT was a standard reference for time keeping when each city kept a different local time. When railways began carrying many people quickly among cities keeping different time, they adopted time zones to simplify operations. By about 1900, almost all time on earth was in the form of standard time zones.   Greenwich Mean Time is now called UTC ([[Coordinated Universal Time]]). UTC is the time standard of the world. All other parts of the world are offset (plus or minus) according to their longitude. Most of the zones are offset by a full hour, but there are some offset by half an hour or 45&nbsp;minutes.  In some parts of the world they follow the [[Daylight Saving Time]] (DST), and during this period of time in summer they add one hour to their normal solar hour.  In the [[Geographical pole|poles]], the time is UTC in the [[North Pole]] and UTC+12 in the [[South Pole]].  The time zones are numbered in relation to the UTC, so in [[Los Angeles]] the time zone will be UTC8, in [[London]] UTC+0, in [[Rome]] UTC+1, and in [[New Delhi]] UTC+5:30.  {{sci-stub}}  [[Category:Time zones| ]]</text>
