<title>Kami</title><text>{{otheruses}} [[Image: Amaterasu_cave_crop.jpg|right|thumb|Amaterasu, one of the most important kami in the Shinto faith]]  '''Kami''' () is a [[Japan]]ese word for the [[spirit]]s that are [[worship]]ped in the [[Shinto]] religion. Not all of Kami are [[Deity|gods]] of the [[personification|personified]] type. Instead, they have to do with [[phenomenon|phenomena]] and [[event]]s like the growth of [[tree]]s, or [[rain]], or [[wind]], or other aspects of [[Nature]]; it is believed that these kami live in those natural things.   It is usually said that there are {{nihongo|"yaoyorozu-no-kami"||eight-million Kami}}. In Japanese the number "eight-million" is normally used to mean [[infinity]].  Though the word ''kami'' can be translated multiple ways into [[English language|English]], no English word expresses its full meaning.  == Some important kami ==  * [[Amaterasu]], the [[sun]] [[goddess]]  * [[Inari (mythology)|Inari]], god of [[fox]]es * [[Kotoamatsukami]], the primary kami [[trinity]] * [[Izanagi]], the first man  * [[Izanami]], the first woman  * [[Shinigami]], kami of [[death]] * [[Ryjin]], god of the sea * [[Susanoo]], [[god]] of [[storm]]s * [[Sarutahiko]], kami of earth  ==Related pages==  * [[Shinto]]  * [[Shinto shrine]] * [[Inugami]]  == Other websites ==  * [http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/shinto-concepts.shtml#kami ''Kami'' at Onmark database] {{-}}  {{Jmyth navbox long}}   {{multistub|religion|Japan}}  [[category:Japanese deities]] [[Category:Shinto]]</text>
