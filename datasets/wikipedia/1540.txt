Its goal is to set up a version of society where the factories and farms are shared by the people, and would not have rulers or [[money]].<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm ''Principles of Communism''], Frederick Engels, 1847, Section 18. "Finally, when all capital, all production, all exchange have been brought together in the hands of the nation, private property will disappear of its own accord, money will become superfluous, and production will so expand and man so change that society will be able to slough off whatever of its old economic habits may remain."</ref><ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1920/abc/03.htm ''The ABC of Communism''], Nikoli Bukharin, 1920, Section 20</ref> <nowiki/>[[File:Communist-manifesto.png|thumb|130px|right|[[The Communist Manifesto]]]]  According to communist writers and thinkers, the goal of communism is to create a stateless, classless society and to end [[capitalism]]. Communist thinkers believe this can happen if the people take away the power of the [[bourgeoisie]] (the ruling class, who own the factories and farms) and establish worker control of the means of production (factories and farms).  Communism is not anti-individualist.  However, it does also say that [[Decision-making|decisions]] should be good for the [[population]] as a whole, instead of just being good for only a few of people in the country.  Since 1992, there have been five nations remaining governed officially by communist ideologies. Four of these follow different forms of [[Marxism-Leninism]] - [[Vietnam]], [[China]], [[Cuba]] and [[Laos]]. The fifth, [[North Korea]], now officially follows [[Juche]], which claims to be a better version of Marxism-Leninism. North Korea called itself Marxist-Leninist before 1991. Many other nations abandoned Marxism around that time because most people thought it had failed. In many cases Marxist governments fell to [[authoritarianism]], mass [[poverty]], [[economic collapse]] and violent conflict, as is the case of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Yugoslavia]], for example.  Some of the most well-known people that have been important in the development of communism include [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and [[Leon Trotsky]].  == History == [[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|150px|Karl Marx, the inventor of communism]]  In 1848, [[Karl Marx|Karl H. Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] wrote ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. It was a short book with the basic ideas of communism. Most socialists and communists today still use this book to help them understand politics and economics. Many non-communists read it too, even if they do not agree with everything in it.  Karl Marx said that for society to change into a communist way of living, there would have to be a period of change. During this period, the workers would govern society. Marx was very interested in the experience of the [[Paris Commune]] of 1870, when the workers of [[Paris]] ran the city following the defeat of the [[French Army]] by the [[Prussian Army]]. He thought that this practical experience was more important than the [[Theory|theoretical]] views of the various [[Extremism|radical]] groups.  Many groups and individuals liked Marx's ideas. By the beginning of the [[Twentieth Century|twentieth century]], there was a worldwide socialist movement called [[Social Democracy]]. It was influenced by his ideas. They said that the workers in different countries had more in common with each other than the workers had in common with the bosses within their own countries. In 1917, [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] led a [[Russia]]n group called the [[Bolshevik]]s in the [[October Revolution]]. They got rid of the temporary government of Russia, which was formed after the [[February Revolution]] against the [[Tsar]] ([[Emperor]]). They established the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], also called the Soviet Union or USSR.  [[File:Engels1862.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Friedrich Engels]]  The Soviet Union was the first country claiming to have established a workers' state. In reality, the country never became communist in the way that Marx and Engels described.  During the 20th century, many people tried to establish workers' states. In the late 1940s, China also [[Chinese Civil War|had a revolution]] and created a new government with [[Mao Zedong]] as its leader. In 1959, the island of [[Cuba]] had [[Cuban Revolution|a revolution]] and created a new government with [[Fidel Castro]] as its leader. At one time, there were many such countries, and it seemed as though communism would win. But communist party governments didn't use [[democracy]] in their governments, a very important part of socialism and communism. Because of this, the governments became separated from the people, making communism difficult. This also led to disagreements and splits between countries.  By the 1960s, one-third of the world had overthrown capitalism and were trying to build communism. Most of these countries followed the model of the Soviet Union. Some followed the model of China. The other two-thirds of the world still lived in capitalism, and this led to a worldwide divide between capitalist countries and communist countries. This was called the "[[Cold War]]" because it was not fought with [[weapon]]s or [[Army|armies]], but competing ideas. However, this could have turned into a large war. During the 1980s, the [[United States]] and the Soviet Union were [[Competition|competing]] to have the biggest army and having the most dangerous weapons. This was called the "Arms Race". President [[Ronald Reagan]] called communist countries like the Soviet Union the "[[Evil empire|Evil Empire]]" because he did not agree with communist ideas.  Since 1989, when the [[Berlin Wall]] was torn down, most countries that used to be communist have returned to capitalism. Communism now has much less [[influence]] around the world. In 1991, the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|Soviet Union broke up]]. However, around a fifth of the world's people still live in states controlled by a communist party. Most of these people are in China. The other countries include [[Cuba]], [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], and [[North Korea]]. There are also communist movements in [[Latin America]] and [[South Africa]].  == Disputes == Many people have written their own ideas about communism. [[Vladimir Lenin]] of Russia thought that there had to be a group of hard-working [[Revolution|revolutionaries]] (called a [[vanguard]]) to lead a [[socialist]] revolution worldwide and create a communist society everywhere. [[Leon Trotsky]], also from Russia, argued that socialism had to be [[international]], and it was not important to make it happen first in Russia. He also did not like [[Joseph Stalin]], who became the leader of the USSR after Lenin's death in 1924. Trotsky was [[Exile|made to leave the Soviet Union]] by Stalin in 1928, and then [[Assassination|killed in 1940]]. This scared many people, and lots of communists argued about whether this was right and whose ideas should be followed.  [[Mao Zedong]] of China thought that other classes would be important to the revolution in [[China]] and other [[Developing country|developing countries]] because the working classes in these countries were small. Mao's ideas on communism are usually called [[Maoism]] or Mao Zedong Thought. After Stalin's death in 1953, Mao saw himself as the leader of worldwide communism until he died in 1976. Today the Chinese government is still ruled by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], but they actually have what is called a mixed economy. They have borrowed many things from [[capitalism]]. The government in China today does not follow Maoism. However, few revolutionaries in other countries like [[India]] and [[Nepal]] still like his ideas and are trying to use them in their own countries.  == Term usage == The word "communism" is not a very specific description of [[left-wing]] political organizations. Many political parties calling themselves "communist" may actually be more reformist (supportive of [[reform]]s and slow change instead of revolution) than some parties calling themselves "socialists". Many communist parties in Latin America have lost many members because these parties do different things than what they promised once they get into power. In [[Chile]], between 1970-1973, under the left-wing [[Coalition]] (groups of parties) of Popular Unity, led by [[Salvador Allende]], the Communist Party of Chile was to the right of the Socialist Party of Chile.  This means it was more [[reform]]ist than the socialist party.  Many communist parties will use a [[reformist]] [[strategy]]. They say working-class people are not organized enough to make big changes to their societies. They put forward [[candidates]] that will be elected democratically. Once communists become elected to [[parliament]] or the [[Senate]], then they will fight for the working class. This will allow working-class people to change their [[capitalist]] society into a socialist one.  == Symbols and culture == [[File:Masthead of the first issue of Combat, Organe Officiel du Parti Communiste d'Haiti.jpg|thumb|Communist [[newspaper]] in [[Haiti]] from the [[1940s]] with hammer and sickle]] The color [[red]] is a [[symbol]] of communism around the world. A red five-pointed star sometimes also stands for communism. The [[hammer and sickle]] is a well-known symbol of communism. It was on the [[flag]]s of many communist countries, like the Soviet Union (see top of article). Some communists also like to use pictures of famous communists from history, such as [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], and [[Mao Zedong]], as symbols of the whole [[philosophy]] of communism.  A song called ''[[The Internationale]]'' was the international song of communism. It has the same [[music]] everywhere, but the words to the song are translated into many languages. The Russian version was the [[national anthem]] of the Soviet Union from 1922 until 1944.  The sickle in the Soviet Union's flag shows the struggle of the peasants-farmers. The hammer in the flag represents the struggle for the workers. Both of them crossing shows their support for each other.  There is also a special kind of [[art]] and [[architecture]] found in many communist and former communist countries. Paintings done in the style of [[socialist realism]] are often done for [[propaganda]] to show a perfect version of a country's people and political leader. Art done in the socialist realism style, such as [[Theatre|plays]], [[movie]]s, [[novel]]s, and [[painting]]s show hard-working, happy, and well-fed factory workers and farmers. Movies, plays and novels in this style often tell stories about workers or soldiers who sacrifice themselves for the good of their country. Paintings often showed [[hero]]ic [[portrait]]s of the leader, or [[landscape]]s showing huge fields of [[wheat]]. [[Stalinist]] architecture was supposed to represent the power and glory of the state and its political leader. Some non-communists also enjoy this kind of art.  == Notable People == * [[Fidel Castro]] * [[Nicolae Ceauescu]] * [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] * [[Che Guevara]] * [[Erich Honecker]] * [[Vladimir Lenin]] * [[Karl Marx]] * [[Friedrich Engels]] * [[Joseph Stalin]] * [[Ho Chi Minh]] * [[Mao Tse-Tung]] * [[Leon Trotsky]] * [[Josip Broz Tito]] * [[Kim Jong Un]] * [[Deng Xiaoping]]  ==Related pages== * [[Anti-capitalism]] * [[Karl Marx]] * [[Marxism]] * [[Trotskyism]] * [[Capitalism]] * [[Socialism]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==Other websites== {{wiktionary}} * {{cite EB1911|wstitle=Communism|short=x}}  [[Category:Communism| ]]</text>
