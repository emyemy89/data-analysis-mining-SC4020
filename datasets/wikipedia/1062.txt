<title>Language family</title><text>[[File:Primary Human Languages Improved Version.png|thumb|400px|Language families of the world today.]]  '''Language families''' are groups of languages that are related to each other because they come from a common older [[language]]. The languages in such a family are similar in their vocabulary or structure.  For example, [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] both come from [[Latin language|Latin]].  Latin was spoken a long time ago, and some of the people who spoke it started to speak one way, saying, for example, for good: "bueno" while another group started saying "bon."  Most words are said a little differently in Spanish and French, so the two are called different languages.  Most languages belong to a language family, but some languages do not. These languages are called '''[[Language isolate]]s'''.  There also are [[constructed language]]s, like for example [[Esperanto]]. Constructed languages are made for different reasons: making a 'world language', for fun, for use in fiction, etc.  ==Major language families== ===By number of languages=== ''[[Ethnologue]]'' 22 (2019) lists these language families as "major".
