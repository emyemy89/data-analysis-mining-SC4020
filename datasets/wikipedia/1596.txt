<title>Line</title><text>{{otheruses}} A '''line''' is the path of one point moving. A line has [[length]] but no [[width]]. A line is a type of [[geometry|geometric]] [[wikt:figure|figure]].  A line is made up of an [[Infinity|endless]] number of [[point (geometry)|points]].  == Straight and curved lines == [[File:CVsimp.svg|thumb|This is a line that curves]] A line can be [[straight]] or [[curve]]d. In [[geometry]], the word ''line'' means a ''straight line''. A straight line is the shortest [[distance]] between two [[point (geometry)|points]]. A straight line is the line traced by a point moving in a [[direction]] that does not [[wikt:change|change]].  A ''curved line'' is sometimes called a [[curve]]. The [[edge]] of a [[circle]] is not straight and is an example of a [[curve]].  == Line segments == A ''line segment'' is part of a line. Here is an example of a straight line segment:   :::<hr width="30%" height="5px" />  == Naming lines == Lines can get their names from any two points on the line. For example, if a line contains two distinct points, named <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>, then the line can be called either <math>\overleftrightarrow{AB}</math>, or <math>\overleftrightarrow{BA}</math>.  Sometimes, lines are also named with just one symbol. In which case, a [[letter]] such as <math>\ell</math> might be used.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-03-01|title=Compendium of Mathematical Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/|access-date=2020-08-16|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Line|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Line.html#:~:text=A%20line%20is%20a%20straight,wiggles%22%20anywhere%20along%20its%20length.|access-date=2020-08-16|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=An introduction to geometry (Geometry, Points, Lines, Planes and Angles)|url=https://www.mathplanet.com/education/geometry/points,-lines,-planes-and-angles/an-introduction-to-geometry|access-date=2020-08-16|website=Mathplanet|language=en}}</ref>  == Two lines == Two lines can be: * [[parallel (geometry)|Parallel]]: Two lines are parallel if they are on the same plane and they never touch. * [[Concurrent]]: Two lines are concurrent if they touch on one point. * [[Coincident]]: Two lines are coincident if they are made of the same points. * [[Perpendicular]]: Two lines are perpendicular if they make four [[right angle]]s where they touch. * [[Skew lines|Skew]]: In [[Euclidean space]], two lines are skew if they are not parallel but they never touch.  ==Related pages== * [[Linear function]] * [[Point (geometry)]] * [[Plane (mathematics)]]  == References == <references /> [[Category:Basic English 850 words]] [[Category:Geometry]]</text>
