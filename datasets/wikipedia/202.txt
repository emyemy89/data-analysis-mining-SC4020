<title>Graph theory</title><text>[[File:6n-graf.svg|thumb|300px|right|An undirected graph.]]  '''Graph theory''' is a field of [[math]]ematics about graphs. A [[Graph (mathematics)|graph]] is an [[abstract]] representation of: a number of [[point (geometry)|point]]s that are connected by [[line]]s. Each point is usually called a ''vertex'' (more than one are called ''vertices''), and the lines are called ''edges''. Graphs are a tool for modelling relationships. They are used to find answers to a number of problems.  Some of these questions are: * What is the best way for a [[mailman]] to get to all of the [[house]]s in the area in the least amount of [[time]]? The points could represent [[street]] corners and lines could represent the houses along the street. (see [[Chinese postman problem]]) * A salesman has to visit different customers, but wants to keep the distance traveled as small as possible. The problem is to find a way so they can do it. This problem is known as [[Travelling Salesman Problem]] (and often abbreviated ''TSP''). It is among the hardest problems to solve. If a commonly believed [[conjecture]] is true (described as '''P'''  '''NP'''), then an exact solution requires one to try all possible routes to find which is shortest. * How many colors would be needed to color a map, if countries sharing a border are colored differently? The points could represent the different areas and the lines could represent that two areas are neighboring. (look at the [[Four color theorem]]) * Can a sketch be drawn in one closed line? The lines of the drawing are the lines of the graph and when two or more lines collide, there is a point in the graph. The task is now to find a way through the graph using each line one time. (look at [[Seven Bridges of Knigsberg]])  == Different kinds of graphs == [[File:Directed.svg|125px|thumb|A directed graph.]] * Graph theory has many aspects. Graphs can be directed or undirected. An example of a directed graph would be the system of roads in a city. Some streets in the city are one way streets. This means, that on those parts there is only one direction to follow. * Graphs can be weighted. An example would be a road network, with distances, or with [[toll]]s (for roads). * The nodes (the circles in the schematic) of a graph are called [[vertex|vertices]]. The lines connecting the nodes are called [[edge]]s. There can be no line between two nodes, there can be one line, or there can be multiple lines. * In graph theory, Trees structures are widely used, they represent [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structures. A Tree is a directed or undirected graph where there is no cycle, meaning: no way of going from one vertex (for example a town) to the same one using each edge you use only once (walking only once on each road you take).   ==History== <span style="font-size: 300%;"> [[File:Konigsberg bridges.png|180px]]  [[File:7 bridges.svg|179px]]  [[File:Knigsberg_graph.svg|180px]] </span>  A visualization of the [[Seven Bridges of Knigsberg|Seven Bridges of Knigberg]]. [[Leonhard Euler]] solved this problem in 1736, which led to the development of [[topology]], and modern graph theory.  A '''graph''' is an [[abstract]] [[data structure]]. It holds nodes that are usually related to each other. A node is a dataset, typically in the form of ordered pairs. Nodes are either connected or not connected to another node. The relation between nodes is usually defined as an Edge. Graphs are useful for their ability to associate nodes with other nodes. There are a few representations of Graphs in practice.  [[File:Konigsberg bridges.png|thumb|200px|The Knigsberg Bridge problem, on a city map]] [[File:Knigsberg_graph.svg|thumb|200px|The same problem, but using a graph]]  [[Leonhard Euler]] used to live in a town called ''Knigsberg.'' (Its name changed to [[Kaliningrad]] in 1946). The town is on the river Pregel. There is an island in the river. There are some bridges across the river. Euler wanted to walk around and use each of the bridges once. He asked if he could do this. In 1736, he published a scientific article where he showed that this was not possible. Today, this problem is known as the [[Seven Bridges of Knigsberg]]. The article is seen as the first paper in the history of graph theory.<ref name="Biggs">{{cite book|author=Biggs, N.; Lloyd, E. and Wilson, R.|title=Graph Theory, 1736-1936|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1986}}</ref>  This article, as well as the one written by [[Alexandre-Thophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]] on the ''[[Knight's tour|knight problem]],'' carried on with the ''analysis situs'' initiated by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Euler's formula was about the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a [[convex]] [[polyhedron]] was studied and generalized by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]<ref name="Cauchy">{{cite journal|author=Cauchy, A.L.|year=1813|title=Recherche sur les polydres - premier mmoire|journal=Journal de l'[[cole Polytechnique]]|volume= 9 (Cahier 16)|pages=6686}}</ref> and [[Simon Antoine Jean L'Huillier|L'Huillier]],<ref name="Lhuillier">{{cite journal|author=L'Huillier, S.-A.-J.|title=Mmoire sur la polydromtrie|journal=Annales de Mathmatiques|volume=3|year=1861|pages=169189}}</ref> and is at the origin of [[topology]].  The fusion of the ideas coming from mathematics with those coming from chemistry is at the origin of a part of the standard terminology of graph theory. In particular, the term "graph" was introduced by [[James Joseph Sylvester|Sylvester]] in an article published in 1878 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.<ref name="Sylvester">{{cite journal|author=Sylvester, J.J.|year=1878|journal=Nature|title=Chemistry and Algebra|volume=17|pages=284|doi=10.1038/017284a0}}</ref>  One of the most famous and productive problems of graph theory is the [[four color problem]]: "Is it true that any map drawn in the plane may have its regions colored with four colors, in such a way that any two regions having a common border have different colors?"  == Graph theory in perspective == Graph theory is an important part of mathematics and computer science. To many such problems, exact solutions do exist. Many times however, they are very hard to calculate. Therefore, very often, [[approximation]]s are used. There are two kinds of such approximations, [[Monte-Carlo algorithm]]s and [[Las-Vegas algorithm]]s.  ==References== {{reflist|2}}  [[Category:Graph theory| ]]</text>
