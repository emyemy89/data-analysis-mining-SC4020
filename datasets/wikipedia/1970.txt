<title>Phoebe (moon)</title><text>[[File:Phoebe cassini.jpg|thumb|A picture of the surface of Phoebe]]   '''Phoebe''' is a [[Satellite (natural)|moon]] which goes around ([[orbit]]s) the [[planet]] called [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]. It takes eighteen months for Phoebe to go all the way around Saturn. It is half made out of [[mineral|rock]], and half made out of [[ice]]. The ground on Phoebe is black, which means that it is very dark when seen from [[Earth]]. Phoebe does not have any [[air]], and there is no [[water]] on its [[surface]].  There are many [[crater]]s on Phoebe. These are from [[asteroids]] and other things crashing into it, and leaving round marks on the surface.  Phoebe is slightly irregular, which means that it is not perfectly round like a ball. It has an average [[diameter]] of 213&nbsp;km. This means that the Earth's moon is 15 times bigger than Phoebe. The duration between two sunrises (rotation period) is only 9 hours and 16.5 minutes long.    {{Moons of Saturn}}  [[Category:Saturn's moons]]</text>
