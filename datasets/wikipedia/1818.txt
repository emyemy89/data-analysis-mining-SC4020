<title>Greenhouse effect</title><text>[[File:Greenhouse Effect.svg|thumb|222x222px]] [[File:The green house effect.svg|thumb]]  The '''greenhouse effect''' occurs when certain gases in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] (the [[air]] around the [[Earth]]) trap [[infrared radiation]]. This makes the planet become warmer, similar to the way it makes a [[greenhouse]] become warmer.<ref>IPCC, 2013: [https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_AnnexIII_FINAL.pdf Annex III: Glossary] [Planton, S.

When there is more greenhouse gas in the air, the air holds more heat. This is why more greenhouse gases cause [[climate change]] and [[global warming]].<ref> {{cite book | title = The Earth's Biosphere: Evolution, Dynamics, and Change| author = Vaclav Smil | publisher = MIT Press | date = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-262-69298-4 | page = 107 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8ntHWPMUgpMC&pg=PA107}}</ref>  The greenhouse effect is natural. It is important for life on Earth. Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's average temperature would be around -18 or -19 degrees [[Celsius]] (0 or 1 degree Fahrenheit). Earth would be locked in an [[ice age]]. Because of the greenhouse effect, the Earth's actual average temperature is 14 degrees Celsius (57 degrees Fahrenheit).   The problem is that recently, the greenhouse effect has become stronger. This is because humans have been using large amounts of [[fossil fuel]]s, which release carbon dioxide when they are burned. Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, it has [[global warming|caused the planet to warm]] over the past 150 years.  About 10,000 years ago, before people started burning large amounts of [[fossil fuels]], there were 260 to 280 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, but now there is over 400&nbsp;ppm. Most scientists say that having 350&nbsp;ppm or less is safe for the [[environment]] and that [[species]] on the planet can adapt to this level.  Higher levels can make severe problems for animal and marine life that are already being seen today, such as [[ocean acidification]].  The greenhouse effect was first proposed by [[Joseph Fourier]] in 1824. [[Mars]], Venus and other planets with atmospheres also have greenhouse effects. The effect on Venus is especially strong because Venus has so much CO<sub>2</sub>. This is why [[Venus]] is hotter than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], even though Mercury is closer to the sun. The first person to predict that carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels (and other combustion processes) could cause global warming was [[Svante Arrhenius]].  ==Related pages== * [[Greenhouse gas]] *[[Global warming]]  == References == {{Reflist}}  == Other websites == * [http://www.climate-change-guide.com/greenhouse-effect.html The Climate Change Guide] easy-to-understand information on the greenhouse effect * [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/science/earth/at-ice-age-end-a-smaller-gap-in-warming-and-carbon-dioxide.html ''Study of Ice Age bolsters carbon and warming link''] February 28, 2013 [[The New York Times]] * [http://marine.rutgers.edu/mrs/education/class/yuri/erb.html Rutgers University: Earth Radiation Budget] * [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect Greenhouse effect] -Citizendium  [[Category:Weather]] [[Category:Climate change]] [[Category:Greenhouse gases]] [[Category:Ecology]]</text>
