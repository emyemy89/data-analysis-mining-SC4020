<title>Nim</title><text>'''Nim''' is a simple game used for examples in [[combinatorial game theory]]. The rules of nim are simple: # The game begins with some piles of [[counter]]s. # Players alternate turns. # On a turn, a player takes counters from a pile. At least one counter must be taken, but up to 3. All counters must be in the same pile. # If a player cannot take a counter, that player loses.  There is a simple [[mathematical]] [[strategy]] to play the game perfectly. If both players play perfectly, the winner is determined by the initial setup.  == Other websites == * [http://www.draftydraft.com/nim/ Nim Game]  {{science-stub}}  [[Category:Game theory]]  [[cs:Rozen forma#NIM]]</text>
