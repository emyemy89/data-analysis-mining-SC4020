It is not connected to any other states by [[United States|American]] [[land]], but it is connected to [[Canada]].  Alaska has many [[glaciers]], some of which are can be seen from passing cruise ships. Some are coastal, and others are not by the [[ocean]]. It is a popular tourist destination, as there is a very rich culture along with beautiful scenery. There are many wild animals in Alaska. Some of them are the [[brown bear]], the [[moose]], and the [[wolf]].  There are some important [[industry|industries]] in Alaska, like [[Oil industry|oil]], [[fishing]], [[mining]], and [[forestry]]. Oil is the biggest industry in Alaska. Most of the oil is very far north in the Alaskan [[arctic]]. A very long [[pipeline]] starts at the northern coast of Alaska and runs to the southern coast. It is over {{convert|800|mi}} long.
