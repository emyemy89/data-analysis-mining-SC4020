It is known for creating and running one of the largest [[search engine]]s on the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW). Every day more than a [[billion]] people use it. Google's [[headquarters]] (known as the "[[Googleplex]]") is in [[Mountain View, California]], part of the [[Silicon Valley]]. The current [[motto]] of Google is "Do the right thing".  Ever since the 2 September 2015, Google is owned by a new [[holding company]] called [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet Inc]], which has taken over some of Google's other projects, such as its [[driver]]less [[car]]s. It is a [[public company]] that [[Stock trading|trades]] on the [[NASDAQ]] under the tickers [http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/goog GOOG] and [http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/googl GOOGL].   Google's search engine can find [[picture]]s, [[video]]s, [[news]], [[Usenet]] newsgroups, and things to [[Online shopping|buy online]]. By June [[2004]], Google had 4.28 billion [[web page]]s on its [[database]], 880 [[million]] pictures and 845 million Usenet messages  six billion things.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/feb/18/internationalnews.onlinesupplement|title=Google expands its search engine|last=Press|first=Associated|date=2004-02-18|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2020-07-21}}</ref> Google's American [[website]] has an [[Alexa]] rank of 1, meaning it is the most widely visited website in the world. It is so widely known that people sometimes use the word "[<nowiki/>[[wikt:google|https://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/google]] google]" as a [[verb]] that means "to search for something on Google"; but because more than half of people on the web use it, "google" has been used to mean "to search the web".  == History == [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]], two students at [[Stanford University]], USA, started BackRub in early 1996. They made it into a company, Google Inc., on [[September 7]], [[1998]] at a friend's garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], [[California]].

The patent was to Stanford University, with Lawrence (Larry) Page as the [[inventor]] (the person who first had the idea).  Google makes a percentage of its money through [[America Online]] and InterActiveCorp. It has a special group known as the Partner Solutions Organization (PSO) which helps make [[contract]]s, helps making accounts better, and gives engineering help.  == How Google makes money == Google makes money by [[advertising]]. People or companies who want people to buy their product, service, or ideas give Google money, and Google shows an advertisement to people Google thinks will click on the advertisement. Google only gets money when people click on the link, so it tries to know as much about people as possible to only show the advertisement to the "right people". It does this with Google Analytics, which sends data back to Google whenever someone visits a web site. From this and other data, Google makes a profile about the person, and then uses this profile to figure out which advertisements to show.  == The name "Google" == The name "Google" is a misspelling of the word ''[[googol]]''.<ref>Koller, David.
