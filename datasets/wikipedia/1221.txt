About fifty-seven [[million]] people live there. South Africa is next to [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Mozambique]], [[Lesotho]] and [[Swaziland]].   The biggest [[city]] of South Africa is [[Johannesburg]]. The country has three [[Capital (city)|capitals]] for different purposes. They are [[Cape Town]], [[Pretoria]], and [[Bloemfontein]]. This is because the [[government]] is based in Pretoria, the [[parliament]] is in Cape Town and the Supreme Court is in Bloemfontein.<ref>{{cite book |title= Family Flip Quiz Geography|last= Gifford|first= Clive|authorlink= |coauthors= Lisa Clayden|year= 2002|publisher= Miles Kelly Publishing|location= Bardfield Centre, Great Bardfield, Essex, CM7 4SL|isbn= 1-84236-146-5|pages= |url= }}</ref>  There are 11 [[national language]]s. They are [[Afrikaans]], [[English Language|English]], Ndebele, Xhosa, [[Zulu language|Zulu]], Swati, Setswana, Sesotho, Sesotho sa Leboa, Venda and Tsonga. They are also known as National Lexicography Units (NLUs). Because of all the languages, the country has an [[wikt:official|official]] name in each language.  One of South Africa's most well known people is [[Nelson Mandela]]. He was its [[President of South Africa|president]] from 1994 until 1999. He died in 2013 at the age of 95. The current president is [[Cyril Ramaphosa]].  Many rare animals such as [[lions]], [[cheetahs]], [[zebras]] and [[giraffes]] live in South Africa.  South Africa is one of the richest countries in Africa.  ==History== The first [[Europe]]an people to come to '''South Africa''' were Portuguese explorers. In 1487, [[Bartolomeu Dias]] found what he called the "Cape of Storms". The [[king]] of [[Portugal]] changed it to "[[Cape of Good Hope]]". He called it this because the cape gave the Portuguese a new chance to find a sea route to [[India]].  In 1652, [[Jan van Riebeeck]] [[colony|colonized]] the Cape. He started the camp for the [[Dutch East India Company]]. This was so that they could give fresh food to ships on their way to the south of [[Asia]]. There were very few [[wikt:native|native]] people living in the Cape. Because of this, slaves were brought from [[Indonesia]], [[Madagascar]] and [[India]] to work at the colony. In 1795, [[Great Britain]] took the Cape from the [[Dutch East India Company]], to stop [[France]] from taking it. The British gave it back in 1803 but then [[Annexation|annexed]] the Cape in 1807 when the [[Dutch East India Company]] went bankrupt.  Diamonds were found in South Africa in 1867. Gold was found in 1884. This made a great number of people to come to South Africa from Europe. They were hoping to make money.  The [[First Boer War]] happened in 1880-1881. The war was between the British and the [[Boers]] Republics. At that time, the British had the Cape. The Boer Republics were established when Dutch settlers moved north in the [[Great Trek]]. The British lost the war and came back 8 years later in 1899. They won this [[Second Boer War]] in 1902. The British had brought many more soldiers the second time. The Boers had no chance of winning. On 31 May 1910 the Union of South Africa was made from the Cape and Natal colonies. It was also made from [[Free State|Orange Free State]] and the [[Transvaal]]. These were two Boer Republics.  == Geography == [[File:South Africa sat.jpg|[[Satellite imagery|Satellite]] picture of South Africa|left|frameless]] South Africa is found at the southernmost [[wikt:region|region]] of Africa, with a long coastline that reaches more than {{convert|abbr=on|2500|km|mi|0}} and along [[two]] oceans (the South [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]]). At {{convert|abbr=on|1219912|km2|mi2}},<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html?countryName=South%20Africa&countryCode=sf&regionCode=af&rank=32#sf|title=Country Comparison|work=World Factbook|publisher=CIA}}</ref> South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world and is almost the size of [[Colombia]]. [[Njesuthi]] in the [[Drakensberg]] at {{convert|abbr=on|3408|m|ft}} is the highest part in South Africa.  [[File:Drakensburgmountains.jpg|thumb|The Drakensberg mountains, the highest mountain range in South Africa]]The back of South Africa is a big and flat. It is a very [[Population|populated]] [[scrubland]], the Karoo, which is drier towards the northwest along the Namib desert. The eastern coastline however, is well-watered, which makes a [[climate]] kind of like the tropics.  To the north of Johannesburg, the [[wikt:altitude|altitude]] drops beyond the {{broken wikt link|escarpment|escarpment}} of the Highveld. It then turns into the lower lying Bushveld, an area of mixed dry forest and a lot of [[animal|wildlife]]. East of the Highveld, beyond the eastern escarpment, the Lowveld reaches towards the Indian Ocean. It has mostly high [[temperature]]s, and is also the location of subtropical agriculture.  === Climate === South Africa has a mostly [[temperate climate]]. It is surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans on three sides, and is located in the climatically milder [[southern hemisphere]]. Average [[wikt:elevation|elevation]] is higher towards the north (towards the [[equator]]) and further inland. Because of this [[wikt:vary|varied]] [[topography]] and oceanic influence, different parts of South Africa have different climates.  There is a [[desert]] in the southern Namib in the farthest northwest and [[subtropical]] climate in the east along the [[Mozambique]] border and the Indian ocean. From the east, the land quickly rises over mountains towards the back [[plateau]] known as the Highveld. Even though South Africa is thought as semi-arid, there is a difference in climate as well as topography.  The southwest has a climate similar to that of the [[Mediterranean]] with mild, moderately wet winters and hot, dry summers. This area also makes much of the wine in South Africa. This [[wikt:region|region]] is also mostly known for its [[wind]], which blows almost all year. The wind can sometimes be severe when passing around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] mostly gets bad for sailors, making many shipwrecks. Further east on the south coast, rainfall falls more evenly throughout the year, making a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the [[Garden Route]].  The [[Orange Free State]] is mostly flat, because it lies in the center of the high plateau. North of the Vaal River, the Highveld becomes better watered and does not get subtropical heat. Johannesburg, in the center of the Highveld, is at 1,740 [[meter|m]] (5,709 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) and gets a yearly rainfall of 740 [[millimeter|mm]] (29.9 [[inch|in]]). Winters in this region are cold, although [[snow]] is rare.  === Plants and wildlife === [[File:Fynbos.jpg|thumb|left|Fynbos, an [[ecozone]] unique to South Africa, near [[Cape Town]]]] South Africa is ranked sixth out of the worlds 17 megadiverse countries,<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Biodiversity of the world by countries|url=http://www.institutoaqualung.com.br/info_biodiversidade23.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040806050616/http://www.institutoaqualung.com.br/info_biodiversidade23.html|archive-date=August 6, 2004|access-date=|website=|language=Portuguese}}</ref> with more than 20,000 different kinds of plants, or about 10% of all the known species of plants on Earth, making it very rich in plant [[biodiversity]].  The most common [[biome]] in South Africa is the grassland, mostly on the Highveld. This is where [[Poaceae|grasses]], low shrubs, and acacia trees, mostly camel-thorn and whitethorn are more common then plants. Plants become even more less common towards the northwest. This is because of low [[rain]]fall. There are many species of water-storing plants like aloes and euphorbias in the very hot and dry Namaqualand area. The grass and thorn [[savanna]] turns slowly into a bush savanna towards the north-east of the country, with more thick growth. There are many numbers of [[baobab]] trees in this area, near the northern end of Kruger National Park.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010410032655/http://www.southafrica-travel.net/pages/e_plants.htm Plants and Vegetation in South Africa], South Africa Online Travel Guide.</ref>  == Economy == South Africa's economy is divided. It is divided between [[First World]] and [[Third World]] standards. The developed part of the economy is similar to that of most nations with wealth (for example, [[Britain]] or [[Australia]]). The rest of the economy is closer to that of poor nations, such as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The main companies in South Africa are mining (mostly for gold and diamonds), [[car]] making, and [[Service Sector|service industries]], such as insurance.  Unemployment is very high. Income inequality is about the same as [[Brazil]]. During 19952003, the number of older jobs went down. [[Informal economy|Informal jobs]] went up. Overall unemployment got worse.<ref name="sach3">{{cite web|url=http://imf.org/external/pubs/nft/2006/soafrica/eng/pasoafr/sach3.pdf|title=Post-Apartheid South Africa: the First Ten Years - Unemployment and the Labor Market|publisher=IMF}}</ref> The [[wikt:average|average]] South African household income went down a lot between 1995 and 2000.

Today, the diversity in foods from many cultures is enjoyed by all and marketed to tourists who wish to taste South African food. Food is not the only thing, music and dance is there too.  South African food is mostly meat-based and has [[wikt:spawn|spawned]] the South African social gathering known as a ''[[braai]]'', or [[barbecue]]. South Africa has also developed into a big wine maker. It has some of the best [[vineyard]]s lying in [[valley]]s around Stellenbosch, Franschoek, Paarl and Barrydale.   South Africa is the only Western country of Africa. Most South African blacks still have poor lives. It is among these people, however, that cultural traditions live most strongly. This is because blacks have become [[city|urbanised]] and [[Western civilization|Westernised]], much parts of traditional culture have fallen. Urban blacks normally speak English or Afrikaans in addition to their native [[tongue]]. There are smaller but still important groups of speakers of [[Khoisan (language)|Khoisan]] languages who are not in the [[eleven]] official [[language]]s, but are one of the eight other officially recognized languages.
