Including small ones, there are about a hundred [[tectonic plate]]. These are only the large ones.   == Primary plates == These seven plates make up most of the seven [[continents]], and the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]]s.  * [[African plate]] * [[Antarctic plate]] * [[Indo-Australian plate]] * [[North American plate]] * [[Pacific plate]] * [[South American plate]] * [[Eurasian plate]]  == Secondary plates == These plates are generally shown on major plate maps, with the exception of the Arabian and Indian plates, which are smaller than the others.  *[[Arabian plate]] *[[Caribbean plate]] *[[Cocos plate]] *[[Juan de Fuca plate]] *[[Indian plate]] *[[Nazca plate]] *[[Philippine Sea plate]] ( also known as the Filipino plate) *[[Scotia plate]] * [[Somali plate]] *Panama Plate  == Tertiary plates == These are parts of major plates, and bits and pieces of ancient plates that became broken up.   * Agean plate  == Related pages== *[[Plate tectonics]]  == Other websites == *[http://element.ess.ucla.edu/publications/2003_PB2002/2003_PB2002.htm Bird, P.
