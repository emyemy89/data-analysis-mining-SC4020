He is a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]].<ref name="nndb.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/360/000022294/|title=George W.

W. Bush]] and former U.S. First Lady [[Barbara Bush]].  He was [[Governor]] of Texas from 1995 to 2000.  Although he originally planned to focus his presidency on programs like education and stay out of foreign wars, the 9/11 terrorist attacks resulted in him changing his perspective. Since then, Bush created the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and sent the military to invade countries like Afghanistan and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]].  In his opinion, the best way to deal with terrorism was to strike before the terrorists could.  == Early life == [[File:GeorgeWBush1947.png|thumb|left|200px|Bush as an infant with his parents, 1947]] Bush was born at Yale New Haven Hospital in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].<ref>Greenstein, Fred I.

His campaign focused on four themes: welfare reform, [[tort reform]], crime reduction, and education improvement. After easily winning the Republican primary, Bush faced popular Democratic incumbent Governor [[Ann Richards]]. Bush won the general election with 53.5&nbsp;percent against Richards' 45.9&nbsp;percent.  Bush used a budget surplus to push through Texas's largest tax-cut, $2 billion. He extended government funding for organizations providing education of the dangers of alcohol and drug use and abuse, and helping to reduce [[domestic violence]].  In 1998, Bush won re-election with a record 69&nbsp;percent of the vote. He became the first governor in Texas history to be elected to two consecutive four-year terms.  Throughout Bush's first term, national attention focused on him as a potential future presidential candidate. Following his re-election, speculation soared. Within a year, he decided to seek the 2000 Republican presidential nomination.  ==2000 Presidential election== {{further|United States presidential election, 2000}} Bush ran against then-Vice President [[Al Gore]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 United States presidential election]].<ref>Bush, George W.

Almost ten years later, on May 2, 2011 bin Laden was killed on orders of President [[Barack Obama]].  The [[war in Afghanistan (2001present)]] has not ended yet.  Bush asked Congress to do more to stop terrorism.  As a result, Congress passed a law that created the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department Of Homeland Security]], a government department which tries to prevent terrorist attacks from happening. It also responds to emergencies such as floods or diseases.  He signed the [[Patriot Act]] (which allowed the government to listen to people's phone calls so it can track down terrorists which try to communicate with each other).<ref>Bush, George W.

George W. Bush signed several acts into law which would help Hurricane Katrina victims. [[File:Vladimir Putin and George W. Bush.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bush with [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]], 2007]] In the Iraq War, no weapons of mass destruction were found, and the Bush Administration was criticized for being wrong about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction. Bush added more American troops to Iraq (which was called "the surge") to speed up the war. The surge was successful, and in result, Iraq had less violence.  Although the economy was doing very well during much of his presidency, in early 2008, the economy was slowing down. Bush signed a bill into law which would gave $600 to every American citizen, hoping that people would go out and spend the money so that it would prevent a [[recession]] (a bad economy) from happening.  Later in 2008, stock market crashed and the country fell into its worst recession since the [[Great Depression]].  Bush helped create a 700 billion dollar bailout, which would give money to corporations (large businesses) to prevent them from being bankrupt and to try to prevent the recession from getting worse.  Bush publicly supported Republican candidate [[John McCain]] during the 2008 presidential election,<ref name="msn.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/|title=MSN - Outlook, Office, Skype, Bing, Breaking News, and Latest Videos|website=www.msn.com}}</ref> but [[Barack Obama]] won the election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/04/election.president/index.html|title=Obama: 'This is your victory' - CNN.com|website=edition.cnn.com}}</ref> During the last few days he was President, Bush gave his farewell address.

The book focuses on fourteen big decisions he made, including quitting drinking, running for president, [[Hurricane Katrina]], invading [[Iraq]], and his response to the financial meltdown in 2008.  On May 2, 2011, President Obama called Bush, who was at a restaurant with his wife, to inform him that Osama bin Laden had been killed.<ref>{{Cite news|title=When Bush Got the Bin Laden Call (While Eating a Souffle)|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/05/when-bush-got-the-bin-laden-call-while-eating-a-souffle/238862/|date=May 13, 2011|last=Franke-Ruta|first=Garance|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=May 14, 2011}}</ref> The Bushes joined the Obamas in New York City to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
