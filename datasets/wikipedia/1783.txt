In [[chemistry]], silver is element 47, a [[transition metal]]. It has an [[atomic weight]] of 107.86 a.m.u. Its symbol is Ag, from the [[Latin]] word for silver, ''argentum''.  ==Properties== ===Physical properties=== Silver is a soft [[metal]]. It is also a [[precious metal]]. When it is used in money or in jewellery, it is often [[mixed]] with [[gold]] or some other metal to make it [[hardness|harder]]. It is bluish-white. It reflects light very well. It is a very good [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] of [[electricity]]. It is considered a precious metal. Silver is very [[malleable]], and [[wikt:ductile|ductile]], which means it can be pulled into [[wire]] or hammered into thin sheets. Silver is one of the only words in the [[English language]] that does not rhyme with any other word. Silver [[coins]] and [[wikt:bar|bars]] can be bought and sold at [[coin]] [[shop]]s around the [[world]].  ===Chemical properties=== [[File:Silver-264109.jpg|thumb|Natural silver tarnished]] It is not reactive. It does not dissolve in most acids. [[Nitric acid]] dissolves it, though, to make [[silver nitrate]]. It does react with strong [[oxidizing agent]]s like [[potassium dichromate]] or [[potassium permanganate]]. It does not corrode easily. It only corrodes when there is [[hydrogen sulfide]] in the air. Then, it forms a black coating known as [[wikt:tarnish|tarnish]].  [[File:Silver(I)-oxide-sample.jpg|thumb|[[Silver(I) oxide]]]] Silver exists in two main [[oxidation state]]s: +1 and +2. The +1 is much more common. A few compounds exist in the +2 oxidation state, but they are very strong oxidizing agents. Silver compounds can be brown, black, yellow, gray, or colorless. Silver compounds are disinfectants.  ;Silver(I) compounds Silver(I) compounds are [[oxidizing agent]]s. They are more common. Most of them are very expensive. *[[Silver bromide]], light yellow *[[Silver carbonate]], yellowish *[[Silver chloride]], white *[[Silver(I) fluoride]], yellow-brown *[[Silver iodate]], colorless *[[Silver iodide]], yellow *[[Silver nitrate]], colorless *[[Silver oxide]], brown-black *[[Silver sulfide]], black  ;Silver(II) compounds Silver(II) compounds are powerful oxidizing agents and rare. *[[Silver(II) fluoride]], strong oxidizing agent, highly reactive, white or gray  ==Occurrence== [[File:Acanthite-40496.jpg|thumb|Acanthite]] [[File:Silver-Calcite-252603.jpg|thumb|left|Silver as a metal]] Silver can be found as a native metal. Silver can be found with [[copper]], [[lead]], or gold in [[mineral|rocks]]. The rocks are found mostly in [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], and the [[United States]]. Peru [[produce]]s the most silver. Silver is also in [[chemical compound]]s. [[Acanthite]] is a silver [[ore]] that is a silver compound.  ==Preparation== Silver is extracted from the earth in several ways. It is normally extracted using [[electrolysis]].  ==Uses== ===As an element=== Silver has been used for many thousands of years by [[wikt:people|people]] all over the [[world]], for [[jewellery]], as [[money]], and many other things. It is called a white metal even though it looks [[grey]]. The word '''silver''' is also used to talk about this color or [[shade]] of grey. Silver is also used for [[wikt:utensil|utensils]]. It may be used to fill teeth in [[dentistry]] as an [[amalgam]]. Silver is used as a [[catalyst]].  ===In compounds=== Silver compounds are disinfectants. It can [[kill]] [[bacteria]] and has other useful properties. It is used in the [[silver oxide battery]]. They are also used in [[photographic film]]. They can also be used to reduce odors in clothes. Some silver compounds are used in creams that help [[burn]]s heal.   ==History== Silver has been around for thousands of years. It was normally considered second to gold in value. Romans used silver as money. The symbol Ag is from the [[Latin]] name for silver, ''argentum''. Silver was also used to prevent infections and decay.  ==Safety== Silver is not a large [[wikt:danger|danger]] to [[human]]s. Silver compounds are toxic. They make the skin turn blue. Some can be [[carcinogen]]s. Colloidal silver, a common [[wikt:homeopathy|homeopathic remedy]], is not toxic in normal amounts, but it does not do much.  ==Market== Silver, because it is depleting, is actually more valuable than gold.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The silver saved up in the world is running out very quickly because more of it has been used each year than the amount mined in each year since 1990. [[Companies]] that use silver have benefited from [[speculator]]s who sell promises to deliver silver that does not exist, keeping prices artificially low. This is called [[naked short selling]]. The amount owed is more than all the silver in the [[world]]. The [[price]] of silver could go very high when the stored silver runs out and investors start asking for their [[metal]] back, instead of taking more [[I.O.U.]]'s.  Silver is 18 [[US dollar]]s per [[troy ounce]] as of June 2010.  Silver increased to 28 [[US dollar]]s per [[troy ounce]] as of December 2010.  {{wiktionary}}  {{Periodic Table}} {{authority control}} [[Category:Basic English 850 words]] [[Category:Metals]] [[Category:Chemical elements]]</text>
