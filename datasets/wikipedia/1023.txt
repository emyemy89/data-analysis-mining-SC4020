They play in the [[English Premier League|Premier League]], the top tier of [[English football league system|English football]]. The club has won 6 [[UEFA Champions League|European Cups]], an English club record, 3 [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cups]], 4 [[UEFA Super Cup]]s, 19 League titles (Including 1 Premier League), 7 [[FA Cup]]s, a record 8 [[Football League Cup|EFL Cups]], title and 1 [[FIFA Club World Cup]] title. Liverpool is the honorest English club with 48 official trophies in total. Liverpool's anthem is "[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]".  == History == Liverpool won their first League championship in 1901, and their second in 1906. They played their first [[FA Cup]] final in 1914, losing 1&ndash;0 to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. The last domestic trophy they won was the [[EFL Cup]] in February 2012, after beating [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. They have also won the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] six times, the most of any British side. Their 5th success was in [[Istanbul]] in 2005. The game was won after Liverpool tied 3&ndash;3 with [[A.C. Milan]], after being down 3&ndash;0 at half-time. The Reds then won the penalty shootout, partly due to goalkeeper [[Jerzy Dudek]]'s saves. Their 6th and most recent success was in 2019 when they beat fellow Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 in Madrid. Liverpool F.C. have won England's top football league 18 times. The club won the 2019-20 Premier League title, thirty years after their last first division title win in the 1989-90 season.  Liverpool has had two [[tragedy|tragedies]] in their history. The first was the Heysel Stadium disaster of 1985, which led to the death of 39 Juventus fans and the second was the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in 1989, which lead to the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans.  == Honours ==  ===League===  *'''[[Football League First Division|First Division]]/[[Premier League]]''' **'''Winners (19):''' 190001, 190506, 192122, 192223, 194647, 196364, 196566, 197273, 197576, 197677, 197879, 197980, 198182, 198283, 198384, 198586, 198788, 198990, 2019-20 *'''[[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]''' **'''Winners (4):''' 189394, 189596, 190405, 196162  === European ===  *'''[[UEFA Champions League|European Cup/UEFA Champions League]]''' **'''Winners (6):''' 197677, 197778, 198081, 198384, 200405, [[201819 UEFA Champions League|201819]] *'''[[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]''' **'''Winners (3):''' 197273, 197576, 200001 *'''[[UEFA Super Cup|European Super Cup/UEFA Super Cup]]''' **'''Winners (4):''' 1977, 2001, 2005, 2019  === Club World Cup ===  * '''Winners (1):''' 2019  === Domestic Cups ===  *'''[[FA Cup]]''' **'''Winners (7):''' 196465, 197374, 198586, 198889, 199192, 200001, 200506 *'''[[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]]''' **'''Winners (8):''' 198081, 198182, 198283, 198384, 199495, 200001, 200203, 201112 (record) *'''FA Charity / Community Shield''' **'''Winners (15):''' 1964*, 1965*, 1966, 1974*, 1976, 1977*, 1979, 1980, 1982, 1986*, 1988, 1989, 1990*, 2001, 2006 (* shared) *'''Sheriff of London Charity Shield:''' **'''Winners (1):''' 1906  === League positions === [[Category:Premier League clubs]] [[Category:Liverpool, Merseyside]] [[Category:1892 establishments in England]] {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left;" |- style="text-align:center;"  !Season !!
