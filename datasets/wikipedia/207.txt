<title>Harbor</title><text>[[Image:Piraeus harbor 3-2004.JPG|thumb|Ship harbor in [[Greece]]]]  '''Harbour''' means to shelter or keep safe. A '''harbor''' (or '''harbour''') is a place where [[ship]]s may shelter.  Some harbours are used as ports to load and unload ships.  The port will have quays or [[pier]]s where the ships may be moored or tied up and a [[transport]] system for taking goods inland.  Often [[railway]] and [[road transport]] will be used.  Goods also move by [[pipeline]] transport and by smaller ships on rivers.  Harbors can be natural as in [[San Francisco]] or artificial as in ancient [[Carthage]] or a mix of both. During the [[D-Day]] operations of [[1944]], two artificial harbors (named [[Mulberry harbour|mulberry]]) were built just off the [[beach]]es where the invasion was going to happen.  == Related pages ==  * [[Dock]] * [[Dockyard]] * [[Marina]] * [[Naval base]] * [[Quay]] * [[Seaport]] * [[Transport]] * [[Wharf]]  [[Category:Basic English 850 words]] [[Category:Ports and harbours| ]]   {{Transport-stub}}</text>
