It weighed 27,060 pounds (12.25 tonnes) and stood 13 feet 8 inches (2.16 m) tall. Their skin color is grey.  At birth, an elephant calf may weigh as much as 100 [[kg]] (225 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]]).  The baby elephant develops for 20 to 22 months inside its mother. No other land animal takes this long to [[gestation|develop before being born]].  In the [[wikt:wild|wild]], elephants have strong [[family]] relationship.  Their ways of acting toward other elephants are hard for people to understand.  They "talk" to each other with very low [[sound]]s. Most elephants sounds are so low, people cannot hear them.  But elephants can hear these sounds far away.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.animalfactguide.com/animal-facts/african-elephant/|title = Elephants|first = Rob|last = Schwimmer|website = |publisher = |accessdate = }}</ref> Elephants have strong, leathery skin to protect themselves.  == Physical description == There are two living [[genera]] of elephants. These are the  [[African elephant|African]] ''Loxodonta africanus'', and the [[Asian elephant]]s ''Elephas maximus''.  === Trunk === An elephant's most [[wikt:obvious|obvious]] part is the trunk.  The trunk is a very long [[nose]], made from the upper lip. An elephant uses its trunk to grab [[wikt:object|object]]s such as [[food]]. Though the rest of an elephant's [[wikt:hide|skin]] is strong and thick, its trunk is very soft and sensitive. Elephants avoid [[Acacia]] trees with  [[ant]]s because they can bite the inside of an elephant's trunk. <ref>{{Cite web |url= http://news.discovery.com/animals/hungry-elephants-are-no-match-for-fearless-ants.html#mkcpgn=rssnws1 |title=Hungry Elephants Are No Match for Fearless Ants : Discovery News  |work=news.discovery.com |accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref><ref>[[Mutualism]] with ants occur on Acacia trees in Africa, such as the [[Whistling Thorn]] acacia. The acacias provide shelter for ants in the thorns and [[nectar]] in extrafloral nectaries for their symbiotic ants such as ''Crematogaster mimosae''. In turn, the ants protect the plant by attacking large mammalian herbivores and stem-boring beetles which damage the plant.</ref>  The trunk is also used when it trumpets. The elephant usually stands still, raises its trunk, and blows. This is a [[Signal (biology)|signal]] to other elephants and wildlife.  === Teeth === Elephants have teeth and  [[tusk]]s. Tusks are large teeth coming out of their [[upper jaw]]s. A lot of [[ivory]] comes from elephant tusks. Ivory [[trader]]s killed many elephants, so now hunting them is [[illegal]].  In total, they have 24 teeth: 12 front teeth, called [[premolar]]s, and 12 back teeth, called [[molar]]s. When the last molar wears out, the elephant dies because it cannot eat. They can live for about 70 years. But in  a [[zoo]] or [[circus]], people can keep elephants alive by feeding them soft food.  Grass wears down their teeth because it has a high concentration of [[silica]] and is very [[abrasive]].<ref>Benton M.J. 1997. ''Vertebrate palaeontology''. 2nd ed, Chapman & Hall, p342. {{ISBN|0-412-73810-4}}</ref> Elephants use their teeth in sequence, not all at once. This means that, at any time, they only have one tooth in each jaw, a total of four.  === The Difference Between African and Asian Elephants.=== African elephants are larger and have bigger ears. They are [[grazer]]s who still do quite a lot of browsing: they eat [[Leaf|leaves]], [[branch]]es and [[grass]]. These big ears have many ''[[vein]]s'', which carry [[blood]] throughout the body. Biologists think that the blood going through their ears helps African elephants to cool off. The weather is hotter in [[Africa]] than in Asia, so it is hard for the African elephants to stay cool. Female African elephants have tusks, but female Asian elephants do not. African elephants have a low place in their back. African elephants have two "fingers" at the end of their trunks, but Asian elephants only have one. Indian elephants eat mainly [[grass]].  Some African elephants live on the savanna while others live in the forest. Today, many people think these are different species. Scientists named the forest group Loxodonta cyclotis and the savanna group Loxodonta africanus.  The African forest elephant is the third largest living land animal in the world.  The Sri Lankan elephant subspecies of mammal.  == Evolution == Elephants are distantly related to [[manatee|sea cows]], which are large aquatic mammals. Early ancestors in the [[Palaeocene]] and [[Eocene]] were small, semi-aquatic animals.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7347284.stm Elephant 'had aquatic ancestor']. BBC News. April 15, 2008.</ref> By the [[Miocene]] several groups of large mainly forest-dwelling elephants evolved, the [[gomphothere]]s and [[Deinotherium|deinotheres]]. Their teeth show little wear, indicating a diet of soft, nongritty, forest vegetation.  Modern elephants  the actual [[family (biology)|family]] [[Elephantidae]]  evolved from gomphotheres as the climate became cooler and drier in the [[Pliocene]] and [[Pleistocene]]. This includes the [[mammoth]] and [[mastodon]] as well as modern elephants.    The gomphotheres lasted  a long time, and were hunted by modern man.  There was a change in plant resources, with the reduced forests and extended grassland. This favoured specialist grass feeders over generalist eaters. This change in the dietary supply was one of the factors which forced gomphotheres toward [[extinction]] in the late Pleistocene in [[South America]].<ref>Sanchez, Begoa ''et al.'' 2004. Feeding ecology, dispersal, and extinction of South American Pleistocene gomphotheres (Gomphotheriidae, Proboscidea). ''Paleobiology'' '''30''' (1) 146-161</ref> The remaining population probably succumbed to climatic change and/or human predation around the time of the [[Holocene]] margin.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/3703396/Extinction_of_a_gomphothere_population_from_Southeastern_Brazil_Taphonomic_paleoecological_and_chronological_remarks "Extinction of a gomphothere population from Southeastern Brazil: Taphonomic, paleoecological and chronological remarks"], ''Quaternary International'', Cristina Bertoni-Machado 2012) (abstract). Retrieved 16 June 2014.</ref>  The significant thing about modern elephants (especially Indian elephants) is that they eat [[grass]]: they are primarily [[grazers]], rather than [[browsers]]. Compared with gomphotheres, the teeth of modern elephants are quite different.  == Uses == Humans have used elephants for different things. The Carthaginian general [[Hannibal]] took some elephants across the [[Alps]] when he fought the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. He probably used the North African elephant, a kind of elephant that does not live today. It was smaller than other African elephants. Elephants are used by tourists as rides.  [[File:Bombay road elephant.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Bombay]] man rides on an elephant.]]  People have used Indian elephants to [[transportation|move around]] and to [[entertainment|have fun]].  Many circuses have them.  [[Siam]]ese, [[India]]ns, and other South Asians used them for several things.  They fought in armies, and they [[crushing by elephant|crushed criminals]].  They also did heavy work like lifting trees and moving logs.  However, people have never ''domesticated'' elephants. Domesticated animals are tame and have babies under human control. The male elephant [[oestrous cycle|in heat]] is dangerous and hard to control.  This state is called [[musth]].  Most elephants used by people are female, except those used in [[war]].  In a battle, female elephants run from males, so armies needed males. Elephants are used by tourists for riding.  ==Status today== Both African and Asian elephants are [[endangered species]].<ref>{{Cite web  |url= http://www.uen.org/utahlink/activities/view_activity.cgi?activity_id=3819  |title=Endangered Animals - Elephants - UEN  |work=uen.org  |accessdate=November 11, 2010 }}</ref>  African elephants receive some legal protection in every country where they are found. However, 70% of their range exists outside protected areas. [[Conservation]] efforts in some areas have led to more elephants. Local numbers may be controlled by contraception or moving the elephants to other places. Large-scale culling (legal killing) ceased in 1988, when [[Zimbabwe]] stopped doing it. In 1989, trade in elephants and their products (ivory, meat) was made illegal. Appendix II status (which allows restricted trade) was given to elephants in [[Botswana]], [[Namibia]] and Zimbabwe in 1997 and South Africa in 2000. In some countries, [[Trophy hunting|sport hunting]] of the animals is legal: Botswana, [[Cameroon]], [[Gabon]], [[Mozambique]], Namibia, South Africa, [[Tanzania]], Zambia, and Zimbabwe have  export quotas for elephant trophies.<ref name=IUCN>Blanc J. 2008.

''Elephants: majestic creatures of the wild''. Checkmark Books, 106113. {{ISBN|0-87596-143-6}}</ref> An elephant's gestation lasts about 22 months. Another female elephant often stays with the new mother until its baby is born. The newborn elephant can often stand within a half hour after it is born. Mother elephants touch their babies gently with their trunks. It takes a baby a year or more to control its trunk and learn its many uses.  Baby elephants nurse for the first two years of their lives. After it is born, the first thing that the baby does is wobble in search of its mother's milk. It drinks about 10 liters of milk every day.  == Miscellaneous == White elephants are considered [[holy]] in [[Thailand]].  The most famous [[fiction]]al elephant is [[Dumbo]].  It is a flying elephant in a [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] movie.  ''The Elephant's Child'' is one of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''Just So Stories''  [[Ganesha]] is the [[Deity|god]] of wisdom in [[Hinduism]]. He has an elephant's head.  The elephant is the [[symbol]] for the [[Republican Party (United States)|United States Republican Party]].  It is like the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]'s [[donkey]]. The first person to use the elephant as a symbol for the Republican Party was [[Thomas Nast]].
