The chief town and capital was [[Weimar]].  == History == Saxe-Weimar and [[Saxe-Gotha]] were the two original Ernestine Duchies. They both gradually shrank in size as land in Thuringia was divided among sons..  In 1741 Duke Ernest Augustus I of Saxe-Weimar inheritated the Duchy of [[Saxe-Eisenach]]. Ernest Augustus II, who succeeded in 1748, died in 1758, and his young widow, [[Anna Amalia, Duchess of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Anna Amalia]], became [[regent]] for her infant son, [[Charles Augustus]]. The regency of Anna Amalia and the reign of Charles Augustus were important in the history of Saxe-Weimar. Both intelligent patrons of literature and art, Anna Amalia and Charles Augustus attracted to their court the leading scholars in Germany, including [[Goethe]], [[Schiller]] and [[Herder]], and made Weimar an important cultural centre.  Charles Augustus joined [[Prussia]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  After France won the [[Battle of Jena]], Saxe Weimar was forced to join the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] in 1806. In 1809 Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Eisenach, which had been separate duchies with the same duke became one country as the Duchy of [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]].  == Dukes of Saxe-Weimar == * [[Johann Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Johann Wilhelm]] (1554  [[1573|73]]) * [[Frederick Wilhelm I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Frederick Wilhelm I]] (1573  1602), son of Johann Wilhelm * [[Johann, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Johann]] (1602  05), son of Johann Wilhelm * [[Johann Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Johann Ernst I]] (1605  20), son of Johann * [[Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Wilhelm]] (1620  62), son of Johann. * [[Johann Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Johann Ernst II]] (1662  83), son of Wilhelm * [[Wilhelm Ernst, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Wilhelm Ernst]] (1683  1728), son of Johann Ernst II * [[Johann Ernst III, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Johann Ernst III]] (1683  1707), son of Johann Ernst II * [[Ernst August I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar|Ernst August I]] (1707  48), son of Johann Ernst III * [[Ernst August II Konstantin, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Ernst August II]] (1748  58), son of Ernst August I * [[Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Karl August]] (1758  1809), son of Ernst August II  Merged with Saxe-Eisenach to form [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]]  ==Related pages== * [[Ernestine duchies]]  == References == * {{1911}} * [http://www.bartleby.com/65/sa/SaxeWeim.html Saxe-Weimar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205094521/http://www.bartleby.com/65/sa/SaxeWeim.html |date=2005-12-05 }}, ''The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition, Columbia University Press (2001  2005), accessed December 22 2005  == Other websites == * [http://www.friesian.com/germany.htm German genealogies] * [http://genroy.free.fr/swe.html Genealogy of Dukes of Saxe-Weimar] {{in lang|fr}}  {{Ernestine duchies}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Saxe-Weimar}} [[Category:States of the Confederation of the Rhine]] [[Category:States of the Holy Roman Empire]] [[Category:Thuringia]] [[Category:Weimar]]</text>
