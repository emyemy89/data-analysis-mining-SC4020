Number 17.4. CIE, 4th edition. {{ISBN|978-3-900734-07-7}}.<br>By the ''International Lighting Vocabulary'', the definition of ''light'' is: Any radiation capable of causing a visual sensation directly.</ref> It is a small part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and [[radiation]] given off by stars like the [[sun]]. Animals can also see light. The study of light, known as [[optics]], is an important research area in modern physics. When light hits an opaque object it forms a [[shadow]] but when the light hits a transparent object, it passes through it almost completely without producing a [[shadow]].  Light is electromagnetic radiation that shows properties of both [[wave]]s and [[Particle physics|particles]]. Light is a form of energy.Light also keeps the Earth warm.  Light exists in tiny energy packets called [[photons]]. Each wave has a [[wavelength]] or [[frequency]]. The human eye sees each wavelength as a different [[color]]. [[Rainbow]]s show the entire spectrum of visible light. The separate colors, moving in from the outer edges, are usually listed as [[red]], [[Orange (color)|orange]], [[yellow]], [[green]], [[blue]], [[indigo]] and [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Other colors can be seen only with special [[camera]]s or [[instrument]]s: Wavelengths below the frequency of red are called [[infrared]], and higher than of violet are called [[ultraviolet]].  The other main properties of light are [[intensity (physics)|intensity]], [[polarization]], [[phase]] and orbital [[angular momentum]].  In [[physics]], the term ''light'' sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not.<ref>{{Citation | title = Camera lenses: from box camera to digital | author = Gregory Hallock Smith | publisher = SPIE Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780819460936 | page = 4 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=6mb0C0cFCEYC&pg=PA4 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = Comprehensive Physics XII | author = Narinder Kumar | publisher = Laxmi Publications | year = 2008 | isbn = 9788170085928 | page = 1416 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=IryMtwHHngIC&pg=PA1416#v=onepage&q= }}</ref> This article is about visible light.

Light moves in a straight line, creating [[shadow]]s when the path of light is blocked. More solid things will have a darker shadow, things that are more clear have a lighter shadow, and [[transparent]] things will have none or very little shadow. Light can pass through transparent things the most easily. When light is not in a vacuum, it travels more slowly than its maximum [[speed of light]]. The slowest light ever recorded moved at 39 [[mph|miles per hour]].<ref>Hau L.V. ''et al'' 1999. Light speed reduction to 17 metres per second in an ultracold atomic gas. ''Nature'' '''397''', p594/8. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v397/n6720/pdf/397594a0.pdf]</ref> Our eyes react to light; when we see something we see the light it [[reflection|reflects]], or the light it emits. For example, a [[lamp]] gives off light, and everything else in the same room as the [[lamp]] reflects its light.  Every [[color]] of light has a different [[wavelength]]. The shorter the wavelength, the more [[energy]] the light has. The speed at which light moves does not depend on its energy. Going through partly clear objects can slow light down by a very small amount.  White light is made up of many different colors of light added together. When white light shines through a [[prism]], it splits up into different colors, becoming a [[spectrum]]. The spectrum contains all of the wavelengths of light that we can see. [[Red]] light has the longest wavelength, and violet (purple) light has the shortest.  Light with a wavelength shorter than violet is called [[ultraviolet]] light. [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s are also forms of light with even shorter wavelengths than [[ultraviolet]]. Light with a wavelength longer than red is called [[infrared]] light. [[Radio wave]]s are a form of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength even longer than infrared light. The [[microwave]]s that are used to heat food in a [[microwave oven]] are also a form of electromagnetic radiation. Our eyes cannot see those kinds of energy, but there are some [[camera]]s that can see them. The various forms of light, both visible and invisible are the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].  When light is [[Refraction|refracted]] in raindrops, a [[rainbow]] is made. The raindrop acts like a [[prism]] and refracts the light until we can see the [[color]]s of the spectrum.[[File:Rainbow in Budapest.jpg|thumb|Rainbow in Budapest shows the colors of the visible spectrum.]]  === Color === Light and color are forms of analog information. However, electronic cameras and computer displays work with digital information. Electronic cameras or document scanners make a digital version of a color image by separating out the full color image into separate [[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]] images. Later, a digital display uses pixels of just those three colors. [[Computer]] [[computer monitor|screens]] use only these three colors in different [[wikt:bright|brightness]] levels. The [[brain]] combines them to see all of the other colors in the image.  People think of objects as having color. This is because the [[molecule]]s that make up the object absorb certain light waves, leaving the other light waves to bounce off. The human eye sees the wavelengths of all of the light that was not absorbed, and the combination of those leaves the brain with the impression of a color.  == References == {{commons|Light}} {{wiktionary}} {{wikiquote-en}}  {{reflist}}  [[Category:Light| ]]</text>
