<title>Shaanxi</title><text>[[File:China Shaanxi.svg|thumb|250px|right|Shaanxi Province in China]] '''Shaanxi''' (Chinese:, also sometimes called '''Shenshi''') is a [[province]] in east [[China]]. The word "Shaan" (viz [[Shanzhou]]) is a place in [[Henan]] Province. "Xi" means "west". So "Shaanxi" means "the place to the west of Shaan".   Although in pinyin, "Shaanxi" is spelled exactly the same as "Shanxi", the only difference in how the two words are pronounced is that the first syllable in "Shanxi" is said using the [[Chinese tone|first tone]] in Mandarin, while the first syllable in "Shaanxi" is said with the [[Chinese tone|third tone]]. Since tone markers are not usually used to show how to pronounce the two different names, the first word in "Shaanxi" is spelled using the [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]] method instead, which indicates tones by adding extra letters to a syllable.  The river [[Wei He]] runs across it. It has a large [[population]] of more than 30 [[million]] people. The capital of Shaanxi is [[Xi'an]]. It abbreviates as '''Shan''' () or '''[[Qin Dynasty|Qin]]''' (), also known as '''SanQin''' (, meaning ''Three Qins'').  == History == [[January 23]], [[1556]]  A massive [[earthquake]], measuring 9.0 on the [[Richter scale]], strikes Shaanxi, killing over 850,000 people. This is the most devastating earthquake in recorded history.  == Political divisions == [[File:Shaanxi prfc map.png|right|thumb|250px|The map of Shanxi Province]] Shaanxi Province is divided into ten [[municipality|municipalities]]:  # [[Xi'an Municipality]]() # [[Ankang Municipality]]() # [[Baoji Municipality]]() # [[Hanzhong Municipality]]() # [[Shangluo Municipality]]() # [[Tongchuan Municipality]]() # [[Weinan Municipality]]() # [[Xianyang Municipality]]() # [[Yan'an Municipality]]() # [[Yulin Municipality]]()  {{Province-level divisions of China}} {{Asia-stub}}  [[Category:Shaanxi| ]]</text>
