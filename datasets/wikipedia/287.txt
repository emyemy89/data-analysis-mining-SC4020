<title>Legislature</title><text>{{nosources|date=June 2019}} '''Legislature''' is a word that comes from the [[Latin]] language, meaning "those who write the [[law]]s." A legislature is therefore a group of people who vote for new laws, for example in a [[state]] or country.  Each person in the legislature is usually either [[election|elected]] or appointed. The [[constitution]] of that state or country usually tells how a legislature is supposed to work.  In many countries, the legislature is called a [[Parliament]], [[Congress]], or [[National Assembly]]. Sometimes there are two groups of members in the legislature. This is called a "''[[bicameralism|bicameral]]''" legislature. A unicameral legislature has only one group of members.  A [[country]], [[district]], [[city]], or other small area may also have something like a legislature. These are often called [[council|councils]], and they make smaller laws for their areas.
