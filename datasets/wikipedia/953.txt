Moscow is an important political, cultural, economic, religious, financial and transportation center.  It is a [[global city]], important in the economic infrastructure of the [[region]]. Moscow was founded by [[Prince]] Yuri Dolgoruki in [[1147]].  The middle of the city is an ancient [[walled city]] called the [[Kremlin]]. There are important government buildings, museums and churches in the Kremlin. Many of the buildings in Moscow, like [[St. Basil's Cathedral]] and Spasskaya Tower, are very beautiful and famous. There are also modern buildings. The many art galleries have big collections.  Moscow has many scientific and educational buildings, as well as some sports complexes built for the [[1980 Summer Olympics]].  Transport includes four international [[airport]]s, nine [[railroad station]]s and the second busiest (after [[Tokyo]]) [[Moscow Metro|metro system]] in the world, which is famous for its artwork.

The beginning of the name is not known, but some people have a few ideas. One is that the name might be from a very old [[Finnish language|Finnic]] language, in which it means "dark" and "cloudy". The first Russian reference to Moscow is from 1147 when [[Yuri Dolgoruki]] called upon the prince of Novgorod-Severski (North [[Novgorod]]) to "come to me, brother, to Moscow."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.oxy.edu/richmond/csp8/history_of_moscow.htm  |title=The History of Moscow |publisher=Occidental College |last=Comins-Richmond |first=Walter |accessdate=2006-07-03}}</ref>  Nine years later, in 1156, Prince [[Yuri Dolgoruki]] ordered the building of a wooden wall, which had to be redone many times, to go around the growing city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://russia.nypl.org/events/Kremlin.html |title=Russia Engages the World: The Building of the Kremlin, 11561516 |publisher=The New York Public Library |accessdate=2006-07-03}}</ref> After the attack of 12371238, when the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] burned the city to the ground and killed its people living there, Moscow grew back and became the capital of the Vladimir-Suzdal principality (an amount of land ruled by a prince) in 1327.<ref name="golden-ring">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscow-city.ru/download/source/Golden_Ring_Engl.pdf/8-11.pdf |format=PDF|title=Along the Moscow Golden Ring |publisher=Moscow,Russia Tourist Information centre |accessdate=2006-07-05}}</ref> Its good place on the start of the [[Volga River]] helped the city to grow slowly bigger and bigger. Moscow turned into a peaceful and rich principality, known as the Grand Duchy of Moscow, for many years and a large number of people from across Russia moved to live there.  Under Ivan I the city replaced [[Tver]] as a political center of Vladimir-Suzdal and became the only collector of taxes for the Mongol-Tatar rulers. By paying high taxes, Ivan worked out an important deal with the Khan. Unlike other principalities, Moscow was not divided among his sons but was passed whole to his oldest. However, Moscow did not like the Mongol rule. In 1380, prince [[Dmitry Donskoy]] of Moscow led a Russian army to an important victory over the [[Tatars]] in the Battle of Kulikovo. Only two years later Moscow was raided by the Khan Tokhtamysh. In 1480, Ivan III finally broke the Russians free from Tatar control, allowing Moscow to become the center of power in Russia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iusb.edu/~journal/2002/vogel_2/vogel.html |title=The Mongol Connection: Mongol Influences on the Development of Moscow |last=Vogel |first=Michael |publisher=Indiana University South Bend |accessdate=2006-07-03 |archive-date=2007-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013011006/http://www.iusb.edu/~journal/2002/vogel_2/vogel.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Under Ivan III the city became the capital of an empire that would eventually include all of  Russia and other countries.

During the PolishMuscovite War (16051618) hetman (army commander) Stanisaw kiewski entered Moscow after he defeated the Russians in the Battle of Klushino. The 17th century had lots of revolutions, such as the Salt Riot (1648), the Copper Riot (1662), and the Moscow Uprising of 1682.

The Plague of 1771 was the last big plague in central Russia, killing 100,000 people in Moscow alone. During the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812, the Muscovites burned the city and ran away, as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]s army was coming near to the city on 14 September. Napoleons army, which was very [[Hunger|hungry]] and cold, had to leave and was nearly destroyed by the freezing Russian winter and some attacks by the army.

[[File:Red Square in Moscow (1801) by Fedor Alekseev.jpg|left|thumb|Red Square, painting of [[Fedor Alekseev]], 1802]]  In 1941, 16 groups of national volunteers (more than 160,000 people), twenty-five [[battalion]]s (18,500 people) and four engineering [[regiment]]s were created among the Muscovites. That November, the German Army was stopped at the edge of the city and then driven off in the [[Battle of Moscow]]. Many factories were moved away, and much of the government was too, and from 20 October the city was declared to be under [[siege]]. Its people who stayed built and used anti-tank defences, and the city was bombed from the air. [[Joseph Stalin]] (the leader of Russia) did not leave the city, so the general staff remained in the city as well. Even with a siege going on, the construction of the [[Moscow Metro]] system continued through the war, and by the end of the war a few new metro lines were open. [[File:Map of Moscow 1784.jpg|right|thumb|Map of Moscow, 1784]]  On 1 May 1944, a medal ''For the defence of Moscow'' and in 1947 another medal ''In memory of the 800th year of Moscow'' were given to Moscow. In commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the victory over [[Nazi Germany]], on 8 May 1965, Moscow became one of twelve Soviet cities awarded the title of [[Hero City]].  In 1980, Moscow hosted the [[1980 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]], which the [[United States]] and several other Western countries did not go to because of the Soviet Union's war in [[Afghanistan]] in the end of 1979. In 1991, Moscow was the scene of a failed overthrow attempt by government members opposed to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. When the USSR ended in the same year, Moscow continued to be the capital of Russia.  Since then, the beginning of a [[market economy]] in Moscow has caused an explosion of Western-style stores, services, [[architecture]], and lifestyles. In 1998, it hosted the first [[World Youth Games]].  == Sister cities == Moscow has many sister cities: * {{flagicon|Algeria}} '''[[Algiers]]''', [[Algeria]] * {{flagicon|Kazakhstan}} '''[[Almaty]]''', [[Kazakhstan]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.almaty.freenet.kz/symbol.htm |title=Almaty official site |access-date=2010-02-15 |archive-date=2009-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304013748/http://www.almaty.freenet.kz/symbol.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> * {{flagicon|Jordan}} '''[[Amman]]''', [[Jordan]] * {{flagicon|Turkey}} '''[[Ankara]]''', [[Turkey]] * {{flagicon|Kazakhstan}} '''[[Nur-Sultan]]''', [[Kazakhstan]] * {{flagicon|Greece}} '''[[Athens]]''', [[Greece]] * {{flagicon|Azerbaijan}} '''[[Baku]]''', [[Azerbaijan]] * {{flagicon|Thailand}} '''[[Bangkok]]''', [[Thailand]] * {{flagicon|Bosnia and Herzegovina}} '''[[Banja Luka]]''', [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] * {{flagicon|People's Republic of China}} '''[[Beijing]]''', [[People's Republic of China|China]] * {{flagicon|Lebanon}} '''[[Beirut]]''', [[Lebanon]] * {{flagicon|Serbia}} '''[[Belgrade]]''', [[Serbia]] * {{flagicon|Germany}} '''[[Berlin]]''', [[Germany]] * {{flagicon|Belgium}} '''[[Brussels]]''', [[Belgium]] * {{flagicon|Romania}} '''[[Bucharest]]''', [[Romania]] * {{flagicon|Egypt}} '''[[Cairo]]''', [[Egypt]] * {{flagicon|United States}} '''[[Chicago]]''', [[Illinois]], [[United States]] * {{flagicon|Peru}} '''[[Cusco]]''', [[Peru]] * {{flagicon|India}} '''[[Delhi]]''', [[India]] * {{flagicon|Ukraine}} '''[[Donetsk]]''', [[Ukraine]] * {{flagicon|United Arab Emirates}} '''[[Dubai]]''', [[United Arab Emirates]] * {{flagicon|Tajikistan}} '''[[Dushanbe]]''', [[Tajikistan]] * {{flagicon|Germany}} '''[[Dsseldorf]]''', [[Germany]]<ref name="Dsseldorf">{{cite web |url=http://www.amazingdusseldorf.com/community-local/people/twin-towns.html |title=Twin Towns |publisher=www.amazingdusseldorf.com |accessdate=2010-02-15 }}</ref> * {{flagicon|Azerbaijan}} '''Ganja''', [[Azerbaijan]] * {{flagicon|Vietnam}} '''[[Hanoi]]''', [[Vietnam]] * {{flagicon|Cuba}} '''[[Havana]]''', [[Cuba]] * {{flagicon|Vietnam}} '''[[Ho Chi Minh City]]''', [[Vietnam]] * {{flagicon|Germany}} '''[[Ingolstadt]]''', [[Germany]] * {{flagicon|Latvia}} '''[[Jelgava]]''', [[Latvia]] * {{flagicon|Ukraine}} '''[[Kharkiv]]''', [[Ukraine]] * {{flagicon|Russia}} '''Kolomna''', [[Russia]] * {{flagicon|Poland}} '''[[Krakw]]''', [[Poland]] * {{flagicon|France}} '''[[Limoges]]''', [[France]] * {{flagicon|Slovenia}} '''[[Ljubljana]]''', [[Slovenia]] * {{flagicon|United Kingdom}}{{flagicon|England}} '''[[London]]''', [[England]], [[United Kingdom]] * {{flagicon|Spain}} '''[[Madrid]]''', [[Spain]] * {{flagicon|Philippines}} '''[[Manila]]''', [[Philippines]]<ref name="Manila.Gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.manila.gov.ph/localgovt.htm#sistercities|title=Sister Cities of Manila|publisher=[[copyright|]] 20082009 [http://www.manila.gov.ph/ City Government of Manila]|accessdate=2010-02-15|archive-date=2013-07-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724041827/http://www.manila.gov.ph/localgovt.htm#sistercities|url-status=dead}}</ref> * {{flagicon|Russia}} '''Naryan-Mar''', [[Russia]] * {{flagicon|Cyprus}} '''[[Nicosia]]''', [[Cyprus]] * {{flagicon|France}} '''[[Paris]]''', [[France]] * {{flagicon|Montenegro}} '''[[Podgorica]]''', [[Montenegro]] * {{flagicon|Czech Republic}} '''[[Prague]]''', [[Czech Republic]]<ref name="Prague Partner Cities">{{cite web|url=http://magistrat.praha-mesto.cz/72647_Partnerska-mesta|title=Prague Partner Cities|publisher=[[copyright|]] 2009 [http://magistrat.praha-mesto.cz/ Magistrt hl. m.
