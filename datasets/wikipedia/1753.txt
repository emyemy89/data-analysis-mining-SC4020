<title>Christopher Columbus</title><text>[[File:Portrait of a Man, Said to be Christopher Columbus.jpg|thumb|painting of Christopher Columbus]]  '''[[Christopher]] Columbus'''  (14511506) was a [[Genoa|Genoese]] [[trade]]r, [[explorer]], and [[Navigation|navigator]]. He was born in [[Genoa]], [[Italy]], in the year 1451.  "Christopher Columbus" is the [[English language|English]] version of Columbus's name.  His real name in [[Italian language|Italian]] was '''Cristoforo Colombo  In 1492 Columbus landed on an island of the [[Bahamas]], the first European to do so. His initial goal was to find a quicker route to Asia from Europe. He is credited with the discovery of the New World because his voyage started the era of [[Colonialism|European colonialism]] in the Americas. This was an important moment in European history. While Leif Erikson was the first European to land on the soils of [[Americas|America]] it was not well documented and did not lead to the later contact between Europe and the New World. The effects was the  bringing over of livestock, disease, crops and slaves  When the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] learned that Columbus had found a [[New World]], many other people, called [[conquistador]]s, went there too.  This led to the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]].  Columbus died on 20 May 1506, in [[Valladolid]], [[Spain]].  == Discovery of America == Columbus was not the first [[Europe]]an person to have discovered America. At the time of his voyage, Europeans did not know that the Americas existed. However, [[Leif Erikson]], around 1000 [[Anno Domini|AD]] had landed in present-day Canada.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Bulygin| first1 = Eugenio| last2 = Gardies| first2 = Jean-Louis| last3 = Niiniluoto| first3 = I.| title = Man, Law and Modern Forms of Life| url = https://archive.org/details/manlawmodernform0000unse| date = June 30, 1985| publisher = Springer Science and Business Media| isbn = 978-90-277-1869-3| page = [https://archive.org/details/manlawmodernform0000unse/page/111 111] }}</ref><ref>{{cite interview |subject=Russell Freedom |subject2= |interviewer=Eric Weiner |title=Coming to America: Who Was First? |type= |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15040888 |program=NPR |call-sign= |city= |date=October 8, 2007 |page= |accessdate=April 20, 2016 |quote=}}</ref> This discovery had no impact on European history and was not well documented.

Columbus, therefore, ''discovered'' America in context of European history.  == Voyage in 1492 == Many people in [[Western Europe]] wanted to find a shorter way to get to Asia. Columbus thought he could get to Asia by sailing [[west]]. He did not know about the [[Western Hemisphere]], so he did not realize it would block him from getting to Asia.<ref name="brit">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Christopher-Columbus |title=Christopher Columbus |author=Flint, Valerie I.J. |date=February 11, 2016 |website=Encyclopdia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopdia Britannica, Inc |accessdate=April 20, 2016 |quote=}}</ref>  However, Columbus did not have enough money to pay for this voyage on his own.

The natives called it Guanahani; Columbus renamed it [[San Salvador|San Salvador Island]] ("Holy [[Savior]]").  He met [[Arawek]] and [[Tano]] Native Americans who lived on the island.  They were friendly and peaceful towards Columbus and his crew.  Not knowing where he was, and thinking that he had reached Asia, the "Indies," he called them "Indians."  He [[wikt:claim|claimed]] their land as Spain's.<ref>"Christopher Columbus." Explorers & Discoverers of the World. Gale, 1993. Gale Biography In Context. Web. February 5, 2013.</ref>  Columbus then sailed to what is now [[Cuba]], then to [[Hispaniola]].  On Hispaniola, Columbus built a [[fort]].  This was one of the first European [[military]] bases in the Western Hemisphere.  He called it Navidad (Spanish for "[[Christmas]]").  He left thirty-nine crew members there, and ordered them to find and store the gold.<ref name="chacon">{{cite book| last1 = Chacon| first1 = Richard J.| last2 = Mendoza| first2 = Ruben G.| title = Latin American Indigenous Warfare and Ritual Violence| date = 2007| publisher = University of Arizona Press| isbn = 978-0-8165-2527-0| pages = 95-96 }}</ref>  ===Treatment of native people===  On the day he landed in the Bahamas, Columbus wrote about the Arawaks and Tano:  {{cquote|They ought to make good and skilled [[servant]]s, [since] they repeat very quickly whatever we say to them.

He had 17 ships and 1,200 men.  These men included soldiers and [[farmer]]s.  There were also [[priest]]s, whose job was to [[religious conversion|convert]] the natives to [[Christianity]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Bacchus| first = M.K.| title = Utilization, Misuse, and Development of Human Resources in the Early West Indian Colonies| year = 1990| publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press| isbn = 0-88920-982-0| pages = 6-7 }}</ref>  On this voyage, Columbus explored some of the islands of the [[Lesser Antilles]].  He also sailed around most of Hispaniola and explored the sides of Jamaica and Cuba he had not seen on his first voyage.  Then he went back to the Navidad fort.  He found the fort [[burn]]ed down.  Eleven of the 37 soldiers Columbus left at the fort were [[burial|buried]] there.  The rest had disappeared.  [[Historian]]s think this happened because of [[disease]] and fights with the Arawak people.<ref name=chacon />  ===Treatment of native people===  While Columbus was away from Navidad exploring Jamaica and Cuba, his soldiers stopped working on building a new fort and [[farm]]s.  They made the Arawaks give them food.  They also [[theft|stole]] things from the Arawaks and [[rape]]d Arawak women.  This made the Arawaks decide to fight back against the Spaniards.  However, Spain had many weapons that the Arawaks had never seen, including [[steel]] [[sword]]s, [[pike]]s, [[crossbow]]s, dogs, and [[horse]]s.  This made it much easier for Spain to win fights against the Arawaks.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Lindaman| first1 = Dana| last2 = Ward| first2 = Kyle| title = History Lessons: How Textbooks from Around the World Portray U.S. History| year = 2006| publisher = The New Press| isbn = 1-59558-082-4| pages = 10-12 }}</ref>  Columbus also took [[revenge]] against the Arawaks for killing his soldiers at Navidad.  He made every native older than 14 give him a certain amount of gold every three months.  If a person did not do this, Columbus's men would cut off their [[hand]]s, and they would [[bleeding to death|bleed to death]].

To avoid getting their hands cut off, many Arawaks tried to run away from Columbus and his men.  However, Columbus's soldiers used dogs to hunt them down and kill them.<ref name=zinn/>  [[Bartolom de las Casas]] said that the Spanish killed two out of every three native people in the area (though he may have been [[exaggerate|exaggerating]]).<ref name=traboulay/>  ====Start of the transatlantic slave trade====  In February 1495, Columbus started the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]].  He and his soldiers captured about 1,500 Tano.  Only 500 could fit on Columbus's ships, so Columbus told his men they could take any of the rest as slaves.  They took 600 and let 400 go.  Of the 500 natives that Columbus shipped to Spain as slaves, about 200 died on the trip.  Half of the rest were very sick when they arrived.  This was the first time people had ever been shipped across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to be sold as slaves.<ref>{{cite book |author=Meltzer, Milton |date=1971 |title=Slavery: A World History |url= |location= |publisher=Da Capo Press |page=6 |isbn=978-0-306-80536-3}}</ref>  Michele da Cuneo, a friend of Columbus's, helped capture natives as slaves.  In a letter, da Cuneo later wrote that Columbus gave him a captured native woman to [[rape]]:  {{cquote|"... I captured a very beautiful Carib woman, whom the said Lord Admiral [Columbus] gave to me. ... She was [[wikt:unwilling|unwilling]], and [so badly scratched] me with her [[fingernail|nails]] that I wished I had never begun.  But ... I then took a piece of rope and [[whip]]ped her soundly, and she let forth such incredible screams that you would not have believed your ears.

[[John II of Portugal|King John II]] of Portugal had said there was a [[continent]] to the south-west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands.  On his third voyage, Columbus wanted to find this continent.<ref>Morison, Samuel Eliot (1963). ''Journals & Other Documents on the Life & Voyages of Christopher Columbus.'' New York: The Heritage Press. p. 262. ASIN B002KR8WPQ.</ref>  Before the voyage, Queen Isabella reminded Columbus that he should treat all of the native people well and make them into Christians.<ref name=traboulay/>  On this voyage, Columbus sent three ships straight to the West Indies (the Caribbean).  He led another three ships: first to two Portuguese islands, then to the [[Canary Islands]], then Cape Verde.  From Cape Verde, they sailed to the northern coast of [[South America]] and landed in [[Trinidad]].  He also explored part of South America and the islands now called [[Tobago]] and [[Grenada]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Edward Lanza JOSEPH (of Trinidad.)| title = History of Trinidad| url = https://books.google.com/?id=3GNZAAAAcAAJ| year = 1838| publisher = | isbn = | pages = 124-126 }}</ref>  On August 19, 1498, Columbus returned to Hispaniola.  He found that many of the Spanish [[settler]]s there were unhappy.  They thought there would be more gold in the New World.  Some of them had [[rebellion|rebelled]] while he was gone.  Columbus had five of the rebellion's leaders [[hanging|hanged]].  He also tried to make the rest of the settlers happy by giving them land in Hispaniola.  However, the settlers kept sending [[wikt:complaint|complaints]] to Spain.  In 1499, Queen Isabella sent a man named Francisco de Bobadilla to Hispaniola.  She gave him the power to do whatever he thought he should do.  When he arrived in 1500, the first thing he did was to have Columbus [[arrest]]ed and sent back to Spain in chains.<ref name=traboulay/>  ===Treatment of native people===  When he was trying to make Spanish settlers happy, Columbus started the ''[[Encomienda]]'' system in Hispaniola.  Under this system, Columbus would give a piece of land in Hispaniola to an individual Spanish settler.  Sometimes, he would give away a whole native village.  Any natives that lived in that area had to work for that Spanish settler.  Natives had lived on this land for centuries. Columbus was giving their land away, ''and'' then forcing them to work on that land.<ref name=traboulay/>  == Later life == On August 23, 1500 Columbus was [[arrest]]ed in Hispaola, now called Santo Domingo, for cruelty to natives and Spaniards. He was sent to Spain in chains in October 1500. He was released on December 25, 1500, and taken to [[court]]. Columbus had important friends, and the King restored his freedom. He was not made governor again, but eventually he was allowed to lead another voyage.  Columbus died of [[heart failure]] and [[arthritis]] in [[Valladolid]], Spain, at the possible age of 54.  == Personal life == Columbus's relatives said that Columbus was born in [[Genoa]], Italy.  Today, no historian can say for sure where Columbus was born.  Most experts think the best [[evidence]] says he was born in Genoa.  However, other historians think Columbus was born somewhere else, like Spain or [[Portugal]].  Some think he was originally a [[Jew]] who [[religious conversion|converted]] to [[Christianity]].<ref name="brit" />  Columbus wrote that he first went to sea when he was 14 years old.<ref>{{cite book| last = Stobaugh| first = James P.| title = World History: Observations and Assessments from Creation to Today: High School Level| year = 2012| publisher = New Leaf Publishing Group| isbn = 0-89051-648-0| page = 175 }}</ref>  In 1477, Columbus [[Marriage|married]] [[Felipa Moniz Perestrelo]].

First, he believed he could find a shorter and easier route to Asia, which made things Europe did not. He believed he could find a shorter route to [[China]].  Other people had called this belief [[wikt:absurd|absurd]].  Columbus wanted to prove these people wrong.<ref name="daniels">{{cite book |author=Daniels, Patricia; Hyslop, Stephen Garrison; & Brinkley, Douglas |title=National Geographic Almanac of World History |url=https://archive.org/details/nationalgeograph0000dani_h7f1 |chapter=Navigating the Globe: 1492 {{ndash}} 1522. |editor= |publisher=National Geographic Books |date=2011 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/nationalgeograph0000dani_h7f1/page/184 184]-185 |isbn=978-1-4262-0890-4}}</ref>  Second, Columbus wanted to find [[gold]].  Gold was the main kind of [[money]] used in Columbus's times.  In his letter to Spain's King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, Columbus wrote: Gold is most excellent; gold is [[wikt:treasure|treasure]], and [the person] who [has] it does all he wishes to in this world."<ref>{{cite book| last = Franzosi| first = Roberto| title = From Words to Numbers: Narrative, Data, and Social Science| year = 2004| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-54145-9| page = 140 }}</ref>  This means that someone with gold can do anything he wants to do. Many [[historian]]s believe that Columbus wanted to become a powerful person {{ndash}} and in order to become powerful, he needed to find gold.  ==After Columbus== When the Spanish learned about the [[New World]], many [[conquistador]]s, or conquerors, went there.  This led to the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]].  The Spanish conquistadors first settled on the islands of [[Hispaniola]] (now the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Haiti]]), [[Cuba]], and [[Puerto Rico]].  They grabbed as much gold as they could.  The Spanish also brought [[priest]]s and forced the Native Americans to convert to [[Christianity]].  == Legacy == In the [[United States]], [[Columbus Day]] is a [[holiday]] that celebrates Columbus's arrival in the New World on October 12, 1492.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/exploration/columbus-day-video|title=Columbus Day|first=History com|last=Editors|publisher=|via=www.history.com}}</ref>  The [[World's Columbian Exposition]], which happened in 1893 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], was held to celebrate the 400th [[anniversary]] of Columbus visiting the Americas.<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11369/ |title = Bird's-Eye View of the World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893 |website = World Digital Library |date = 1893 |accessdate = 2013-07-17 }}</ref>  == References == {{commons}} {{reflist}}  {{Authority control}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Columbus, Christopher}} [[Category:1451 births]] [[Category:1506 deaths]] [[Category:Deaths from heart failure]] [[Category:Disease-related deaths in Spain]] [[Category:Italian explorers]] [[Category:People from Genoa]]</text>
