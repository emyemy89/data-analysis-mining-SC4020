<title>Wikipedia:Deletion review</title><text>{{shortcut|WP:RFU|WP:DRV|}} If you think a review of a deletion discussion is needed, please list it here and say why.  Users can then comment to reach an agreement on whether the community thinks the discussion was closed correctly, or the decision should be overturned.  Each user can say if he or she wants to '''endorse''' the closure, or '''overturn''' the closure, with a brief comment, and sign with <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>.  A page should stay listed here for at least 5 to 7 days. After that time, an administrator will decide if there is a [[Wikipedia:Consensus|consensus]] (agreement) about what to do, and take appropriate steps.  If the consensus was that the discussion was closed correctly, the discussion should be closed with a note saying this.  {{archive box collapsible|large=yes| * [[Wikipedia:Deletion review/Archive 1|20072012]] * [[Wikipedia:Deletion review/Archive 2|20132016]] * [[Wikipedia:Deletion review/Archive 3|20172019]] * [[Wikipedia:Deletion review/Archive 4|2020Current]] }}  {{Please leave this line alone.}} [[Category:Wikipedia administration]]  ==Current requests==  ===[[Philippine Institute of Chemical Engineers]]=== Was deleted by {{u|Macdonald-ross}} for 2 reasons - G4 / G11. This is problematic in all cause. [[Wikipedia:Requests for deletion/Requests/2021/Philippine Institute of Chemical Engineers]] as the page had been kept at a RFD, QD requests cannot be carried out at all barring some circumstances (we don't have a local policy but per [[WP:FOLLOW]] and [[:en:Wikipedia:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion#Pages_that_have_survived_deletion_discussions]]), none of those criterias applies here. In addition, both QD criterions cannot be true. G4 isn't true as there is no RFD result that lead to delete as well as there is no resemblance here. G11 cannot be true too as the page have a non-infringing version that survived RFD (per talkpage which is also deleted, this cannot be deemed as G11 after community discussion), so it should be reverted to that. Overall the entire deletion was erroneous, and I wish the page can be restored. Thanks. [[User:Camouflaged Mirage|Camouflaged Mirage]] ([[User talk:Camouflaged Mirage|talk]]) 11:34, 24 February 2021 (UTC) *'''Overturn''' - from what I can see, I doubt there was a valid reason to delete per G11 given the previous discussion, and G4 couldn't possibly have applied in that case either. --[[User:ImprovedWikiImprovment|IWI]] ([[User talk:ImprovedWikiImprovment|talk]]) 12:01, 24 February 2021 (UTC)  [[User:Macdonald-ross|Macdonald-ross]], this page was kept in an RfD under a week ago.

There is a page called Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai that I created. For some reason, an admin deleted that page and it was an error. I worked hard on creating that page and none of the content that I put on that page was copyrighted. So can anyone of you please restore the page? Thanks.

This is not to say that the page won't be deleted for another reason. --[[User:Auntof6|Auntof6]] ([[User talk:Auntof6|talk]]) 21:58, 30 January 2021 (UTC) ::@[[User:Auntof6|Auntof6]] Both the current version and the previous are copyvio, G4 surely is not valid but G12 does and you also restore a copyvio version. Am I correct to say so? Much appreciated any advices. [[User:CM-Public|CM-Public]] ([[User talk:CM-Public|talk]]) 22:05, 30 January 2021 (UTC) :::{{re|CM-Public}} G12 would apply if the text was copied. However, before I restored it, I looked at the IMDB page that was cited in the original request, and I didn't find a match. If I had found a match, I would have immediately deleted the article again after restoring it. --[[User:Auntof6|Auntof6]] ([[User talk:Auntof6|talk]]) 22:10, 30 January 2021 (UTC) ::::@[[User:Auntof6|Auntof6]] What I meant is the 1st 3 versions are copyvio, you shouldn't restore. Last few are full of copy pasting of different parts of the sypnosis, making it still copyvio with close paraphrasing in others. [[User:CM-Public|CM-Public]] ([[User talk:CM-Public|talk]]) 22:17, 30 January 2021 (UTC) :::::For the record, the page was re-deleted by {{u|Operator873}} per CM's request. --[[User:ImprovedWikiImprovment|IWI]] ([[User talk:ImprovedWikiImprovment|talk]]) 05:23, 31 January 2021 (UTC) ::::::For completeness, now [[User:Saroj Uprety]] had created a redirect to a clean, non-copyrighted version of the article which he created. I think this is the best result, copyright offending versions deleted, clean version created. [[User:Camouflaged Mirage|Camouflaged Mirage]] ([[User talk:Camouflaged Mirage|talk]]) 10:46, 31 January 2021 (UTC)  ===[[Gowri Nadella]]=== This page was originally deleted this morning due to a request from a bot asking for deletion of the article as I was trying to revise it. While the original draft lacked credible sources, I was able to find several credible news outlets that have published articles about Gowri Nadella, such as SEEMA Magazine, India Tribune, Nyota Magazine, and several other publications. I also revised the original draft by changing the verbiage to better fit that of a Wikipedia article. This article conveys the notability and significance of Gowri Nadella and meets the Wikipedia guidelines. I kindly request this article be brought back. Thank you. <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:2601:249:880:ab30:3406:9cf8:8965:9e42|2601:249:880:ab30:3406:9cf8:8965:9e42]] ([[User talk:2601:249:880:ab30:3406:9cf8:8965:9e42#top|talk]]  [[Special:Contributions/2601:249:880:ab30:3406:9cf8:8965:9e42|contribs]]) 16:30, 29 January 2021 (UTC)</small> :see [[Wikipedia:Requests for deletion/Requests/2021/Gowri Nadella|the RfD]]; the deletion discussion has been there for a week; in this week, 3 people agreed with the nominator, giving reasons. This resulted in 3 delete votes, and no keeps after the week, so it got deleted. I don't see a reason to undelete it, as most arguments are about the person ([[:WP:NOTABLE|notability]], and seach results), and not the article we had. --[[User:Eptalon|Eptalon]] ([[User talk:Eptalon|talk]]) 16:07, 30 January 2021 (UTC) *{{ec}}'''Endorse closure''' - The discussion had a clear consensus, and the person does not appear to be notable at this time. If you can demonstrate some coverage here in this discussion that shows she is notable, the article can be recreated. So far, that has not been provided. --[[User:ImprovedWikiImprovment|IWI]] ([[User talk:ImprovedWikiImprovment|talk]]) 16:09, 30 January 2021 (UTC)  ===[[Barron Trump]]=== The page was originally quickly deleted last year by {{u|Macdonald-ross}}, which was contseted and restored by {{u|Vermont}}. Now the page has been deleted again by Macdonald-ross. I think this is a matter for RfD, not QD, especially given the objection by another sysop. It may not have been intentional, but it could be viewed as [[:en:WP:WHEELWAR|wheel warring]]. --[[User:ImprovedWikiImprovment|IWI]] ([[User talk:ImprovedWikiImprovment|talk]]) 11:25, 14 January 2021 (UTC)  :No comments on the admin part, but if this is a RFD I will per enwp [[:en:Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Barron_Trump_(2nd_nomination)]] (do see the 1st one too), both ended up with just redirecting which I am also keen to. He isn't that famous as per his siblings, and a redirect and content placed within Trump article should be okay.

This is similar to EN's CSD A7. :::*QD A4 does '''not''' mean that the subject of the article was found to be not notable. Whether the subject of an article is notable or not, is a decision to be made at RfD, and not summarily via the QD mechanism. :::*The deletion policy explicitly excludes the following from QD eligibility.
