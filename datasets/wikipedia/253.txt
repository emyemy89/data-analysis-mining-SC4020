The Yayoi were an ancient ethnic group that migrated to the Japanese archipelago mainly from [[China|southeastern China]] during the Yayoi period (300 BCE300 CE). Modern [[Japanese people]] have primarily Yayoi ancestry at an average of 97%.<ref>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/03/15/579177.full.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/fukayomi/20171214-OYT8T50003/|title= : |date=2017-12-15|website=|language=ja|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref> The indigenous [[Ryukyuan people|Ryukyuan]] and [[Ainu people|Ainu]] peoples have more Jmon ancestry on the other hand.  The earliest records on Japan are from [[China|Chinese]] documents. One of those records said there were many small countries (in Japan) which had wars between them and later a country, ruled by a queen, became the strongest, unified others, and brought peace.  The Japanese began to write their own history after the [[5th century|5th]] and [[6th century|6th centuries]], when people from [[Korea]] and China taught Japan about the [[Chinese writing system]]. Japan's neighbours also taught them [[Buddhism]].<ref name="'Japan history'">{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2131.html |title=Early Japan (until 710) |accessdate=2009-06-16 |work=japan-guide.com }}</ref> The Japanese changed Buddhism in many ways. For example, Japanese Buddhists used ideas such as [[Zen]] more than other Buddhists.<ref name="'Japan history'" />  Japan had some contact with the Europeans in the [[16th century]]. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first Europeans to visit Japan. Later, the [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Holland|Dutch]] came to Japan to trade. Also, they brought [[Christianity]]. Japan's leaders welcomed them at first, but because Europeans had conquered many places in the world, the Japanese were scared they would conquer Japan too. So the Japanese did not let the Europeans come into Japan anymore, except in a small area in [[Nagasaki]] city. Many Christians were killed. Only the Chinese, Korean and Dutch people were allowed to visit Japan, in the end, and they were under careful control of the Japanese government. Japan was opened for visitors again in [[1854]] by Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]], when the [[United States|Americans]] wanted to use Japanese ports for American [[whale]] boats. Perry brought steamships with guns, which scared the Japanese into making an agreement with him.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/teach/ends/opening.htm |title=Perry & Opening of Japan |work=history.navy.mil |year= 2009 |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}</ref>  This new contact with Europeans and Americans changed the Japanese culture. The [[Meiji Restoration]] of [[1868]] stopped some old ways and added many new ones. The [[Empire of Japan]] was created, and it became a very powerful nation and tried to invade the countries next to it. It invaded and [[annexation|annexed]] [[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyu]] Kingdom, [[Taiwan]], and Korea. It had wars with China and Russia: the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Boxer Rebellion]], the [[Russo-Japanese War]], and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], which grew to become a part of [[World War II]] when Japan became allies with [[Nazi Germany]] and Fascist Italy.  In 1941, Japan attacked [[Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]], a water base of the United States, and destroyed or damaged many ships and airplanes. This started the United States' involvement in [[World War II]]. American and Japanese forces fought each other in the Pacific. Once airbases were established within range of the Japanese mainland, America began to win, and started dropping bombs on Japanese cities. America was able to bomb most of the important cities and quickly brought Japan close to defeat. To make Japan surrender, the United States dropped two [[atomic bomb]]s on the cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], killing 150,000 Japanese citizens. Soon after this the [[Soviet Union]] began to fight against Japan, and the Japanese army in [[Manchuria]] lost. Japan surrendered and gave up all the places it took from other countries, accepting the [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]] Proclamation. The United States occupied Japan and forced it to write a new [[constitution]], in which it promised to never go to war again.  ==Geography==  Japan is a group of islands in the Western [[Pacific]], off the coast of China. The four biggest islands are [[Honshu]], [[Hokkaido]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Kyushu]], and there are about 6,000 smaller islands there. Japan is separated from the Asian continent by the [[Sea of Japan]] and the East China Sea. Honshu, which means 'Mainland' in the [[Japanese language]], is the biggest island. Hokkaido is the island north of Honshu. Kyushu is the island west of Honshu. Shikoku is the island to the south-west of Honshu.<ref name='CIA Factbook' />  In the middle of Japan there are mountains.<ref name='CIA Factbook' /> They cover the middle of the islands and leave a very narrow strip of flat land on most coasts. Many of the mountains are extinct [[volcano]]es, but some are still active. The highest of these mountains is the beautiful, volcano-shaped Mt Fuji (3,776&nbsp;metres or 12,389&nbsp;feet high). Japan has many earthquakes, in fact there are about 1500 of these every year.<ref name='CIA Factbook' /> The biggest earthquake recorded in Japan was in 2011 - called '2011 Tohoku Earthquake'. It caused great damage to several power plants forcing Japan to shut down all its nuclear plants. There was nuclear core meltdown which caused a serious health risk to nearby villages and cities.  90% of the people living in Japan live in just 10% of the [[land]], near the coast. The other 10% of the people in Japan live away from the coast.  Over 10 cities have more than a million people in them. The biggest city in Japan is [[Tokyo]], which is the capital. [[File:Skyscrapers of Shinjuku 2009 January.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tokyo]]]]  ==Politics and government== {{further|Government of Japan}} The ruling party is the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)]] and the prime minister is Yoshihide Suga. The legislature of Japan is called the [[Diet of Japan|National Diet]].  ==Science and technology== In the past, the Japanese learned science by way of China or from [[Europe]] in the [[Meiji Era]]. However, in recent decades Japan has been a leading innovator in several fields, including [[chemical engineering]], [[nanotechnology]], and robotics. There are many technological companies in Japan, and these companies make products for export.  The robot Asimo was made and introduced in 2000. It was manufactured by [[Honda]].  ==Society and culture==  {{see also|Japanese tea ceremony|Noh|Kabuki}}  Many things in Japanese culture originated in [[China]], like [[Go]] and [[bonsai]].  Japan's traditional food is [[seafood]], rice, [[miso soup]], and vegetables. [[Noodles]] and [[tofu]] are also common. [[Sushi]], a Japanese food made of cooked rice with [[vinegar]] with other ingredients such as raw fish, is popular around the world.  The religion in Japan is mostly [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhist]]. Due to the tolerant nature of the two main Japanese religions, and the resulting intermixing of the two, many Japanese identify as both Shinto and Buddhist at the same time. There are small numbers of [[Christian]]s and [[Muslim]]s, and a few [[Jew]]s.  When it comes to [[popular culture]], Japan is famous for making [[video game]]s. Many of the biggest companies that make games, like [[Nintendo]], [[Namco]], and [[Sega]], are Japanese. Other well-known parts of Japanese [[arts]] are [[comics]], called [[manga]], and digital [[animation]], or [[anime]]. Many people get to know Japanese or how life in Japan is like by reading manga or watching anime on [[television]].  The [[Ryukyuan people|Ryukyuans]] and the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] both have their own separate cultures, languages and religion.  ==Armed forces== {{further|Imperial Japanese Army}}  ==Education== {{further|List of national universities in Japan}}  ==Cities== The biggest cities in Japan are: * [[Tokyo]] (Capital City * [[Yokohama]] * [[Nagoya]] * [[Osaka]] * [[Kyoto]] * [[Kobe]] * [[Hiroshima]] * [[Fukuoka]] * [[Kitakyushu]] * [[Sendai, Miyagi|Sendai]] * [[Sapporo]] * [[Nagasaki]]  In Japan there are seven  traditional regions:<ref>{{cite book| author = Louis-Frdric| title = Japan Encyclopedia| url = https://books.google.com/?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA242| year = 2005| publisher = Harvard University Press| isbn = 978-0-674-01753-5| page = 242 }}</ref> * [[Hokkaido]] * [[Tohoku]] * [[Kanto]] * [[Chubu]] * [[Kansai]] * [[Chugoku]] * [[Shikoku]] * [[Kyushu]]   ===Territorial problem=== Since Japan is an island nation, Japan has several problems over territory because maritime boundaries can be hard to protect. These days, Japan is competing for at least 4 different territories. It cannot agree with some neighbouring countries on whether the land belongs to Japan or the other country. * [[Senkaku Islands]] problem (with [[China]] and [[Taiwan]]) * [[Liancourt Rocks]] island problem (with [[South Korea]]) * Southern [[Chishima Islands]] problem (with [[Russia]]) * [[Sea of Japan]] problem (with [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]])  ==Public transportation== [[File:JR Central Shinkansen 700.jpg|thumb|left|High speed [[Shinkansen]] or ''Bullet trains'' are a common form of transportation in Japan.]]  There are several important international airports in Japan. [[Narita]] is the major international airport in the Tokyo area. Kansai International Airport serves as the main airport for [[Osaka]], [[Kobe]], and [[Kyoto]].
