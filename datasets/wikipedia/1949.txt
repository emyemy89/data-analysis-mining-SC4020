It is one of the South's largest cities. Atlanta is known as a major business city. It is the home of [[Coca-Cola Company]], [[CNN]], [[AT&T]], and [[Home Depot]], as well as many other [[Fortune 500]] companies. [[Coca-Cola]], which is made in Atlanta, is drunk all over the world and its factory is a favorite tourist destination. CNN is also a big tourist attraction. Atlanta's airport, called Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, is the busiest airport in the world. Atlanta is near the center of Georgia and is on the [[Chattahoochee River]].  == History == Atlanta was built on [[Cherokee]] [[Native American]] land. It was called Terminus until 1843, when the name was changed to Marthasville. In 1845 the name was changed again to Atlanta.  During the [[American Civil War]], Atlanta was where several battles happened. Some of the battles were the Battle of Peachtree Creek, the Battle of Atlanta, and the Battle of Ezra Church. The city was burnt down and almost entirely destroyed. After the war, the city was built again, and got a [[nickname]] because it was built so fast: "the Phoenix City", after the bird which burns itself then rises from the ashes in old myths. A picture of the bird is on the city seal.  Atlanta became the state capital in 1868.  There have been racial problems in Atlanta. During riots in 1906, at least 12 people died and more than 70 other people were hurt. In 1913, a Jewish man named Leo Frank was tried in court for [[rape|raping]] and killing a girl in a factory where he worked. He was found guilty, but then the government decided not to execute him because not everyone was convinced he had done it. This upset people who thought he had killed the girl, and there were more riots in 1915 and Frank was lynched (hanged with a rope until he died).  In the 1930s, the [[Great Depression]] came to Atlanta. Many people did not have jobs and were hungry. The city government was almost out of money and the [[Coca-Cola]] company gave the city some money to help. In 1935, the government built the first federal [[housing project]] in the United States.  Atlanta's airport is named Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. It is the busiest airport in the world. [[Delta Air Lines]] is an [[airline]] that has its main office in Atlanta, and it uses Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport for many of its flights.  [[Turner Broadcasting]], which broadcasts [[CNN]], has their main office in Atlanta. [[Coca Cola|The Coca Cola Company]] also has their main office in Atlanta.  Atlanta is rich in [[African American]] history and [[hip-hop]] culture.  Famous rappers from Atlanta are [[Gucci Mane]], [[Jeezy]], [[Ludacris]], [[Lil Yachty]] and [[2 Chainz]].  ==Education== The City of Atlanta is home to two colleges. [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], or Georgia Tech for short, and [[Georgia State University]].  == Events ==  {| class="wikitable sortable" |- ! Year !!
