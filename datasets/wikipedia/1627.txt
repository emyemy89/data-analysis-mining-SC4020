<title>List of galaxies</title><text>'''List of [[galaxy|galaxies]]''' and [[galaxy cluster]]s. Because there are so many galaxies in the [[universe]], this list has been divided into several categories.  The first catalog that catalogues galaxies is the Catalogue of Galaxies and of Clusters of Galaxies.  == List of nearby galaxies == This is list of nearby galaxies to the [[Milky Way|Milky Way Galaxy]], our galaxy. The first four listed below are part of the [[Local Group]] of galaxies, a galaxy group containing at least 50 galaxies, including the Milky Way and Andromeda.  {| class="wikitable" |+ List of nearby Galaxies !Image !Name !Distance !Information |- |[[File:Large.mc.arp.750pix.jpg|95x95px]] |[[Large Magellanic Cloud]] |162,980 [[light years]] |This is a galaxy satellite of our Milky Way, and the prototype for the class "Magellanic type spiral". |- |[[File:VISTAs view of the Small Magellanic Cloud.jpg|95x95px]] |[[Small Magellanic Cloud]] | 200,000 light years |This is a galaxy satellite of our Milky Way. |- |[[File:ANDROMEDA GALAXY.jpg|95x95px]] |[[Andromeda Galaxy]] | 2,500,000 light years |Largest galaxy in the Local Group |- |[[File:M33 2 PS wiki.jpg|95x95px]] |[[Triangulum Galaxy]] | 3,000,000 light years |Second nearest large galaxy to the Milky Way; Third largest galaxy in the Local Group. |- |[[File:NGC 3109 2MASS.jpg|95x95px]] |[[NGC 3109]] | 4,300,000 light years |On the outskirts of the [[Local Group]];  may be a Magellanic type spiral . |- |[[File:View of the southern spiral NGC 300.jpg|95x95px]] |[[NGC 300]] | 6,000,000 light years |Between the [[Sculptor Group]] and the Local Group; might form a gravitationally bound pair with NGC 55 (see below). |- |[[File:ESO-NGC55-WFI-phot-14a-09-fullres.tif|95x95px]] |[[NGC 55]] |7,200,000 light years |Might form a gravitationally bound pair with NGC 300 (see above) |}  == List of farthest galaxies == This is list of farthest galaxy from Milky Way. Remember, the farther away from a galaxy, the greater the redshift of galaxy. Redshift is when object appear in a red color because the distance is farther away.   Note that the idea that the radius of the observable universe must amount to only 13.8 billion light-years (like the age of universe) is incorrect. Light travel distance (LTD) is time required for light to reach the observer.  () means "almost equal to."  {| class="wikitable" |+ Farthest galaxies !Image !Name !Distance !Redshift |- |[[File:Distant galaxy GN-z11 in GOODS-N image by HST.jpg|150x150px]] |[[GN-z11]] | 32 billion light years (proper distance)  13.8 billion light years (light travel distance) |z = 11.09 |- |[[File:EGSY8p7 por el Hubble y Spitzer.jpg|150x150pxpx]] |[[EGSY8p7]] |13.2 billion light years (light travel distance) |z = 8.68 |- |[[File:Galaxy-EGS-zs8-1-20150505.jpg|150x150px]] |[[EGS-zs8-1]] |13.04 billion light years (light travel distance) |z = 7.73 |} And other galaxies : * [[Abell 1835 IR1916]] * [[Andromeda I]] * [[Andromeda II]] * [[Andromeda III]] * [[Andromeda XIX]] * [[Baby boom galaxy]] * [[Black Eye galaxy]] (M64) * [[Messier 81|Bode's galaxy]] (M81) * [[Canis Major dwarf galaxy]] * [[Cartwheel galaxy]] * [[Centaurus A galaxy]] (NGC 5128) * [[Circinus galaxy]] * [[M82|Cigar galaxy]] (M82) * [[Hoag's object]] (a ring galaxy) * [[IC 10]] * [[IC 1101]] (Largest known galaxy with about 100 trillion stars) * [[IC 1613]] * [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]  * [[Leo I (Galaxy)|Leo I]] * [[Leo II (Galaxy)|Leo II]] * [[LGS 3]] * [[Messier 49]] (NGC 4472) * [[Messier 83]] (Southern Pinwheel galaxy) * [[Messier 84]] (NGC 4374) * [[Messier 87]] (NGC 4486) * [[Messier 100]] (NGC 4321) * [[NGC 185]] * [[NGC 147]] * [[NGC 205]] (M110) * [[NGS 221]] (M32) * [[NGC 4526]] * [[NGC 6822]] (Barnard's Galaxy) * [[Pinwheel galaxy]] (M101) * [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] * [[Sombrero galaxy]] (M104) Named Sombrero because it looks like a sombrero. * [[Spindle galaxy]] (M102) * [[Starfish galaxy]]- This is actually 2 Galaxies near the end of a merger. * [[Sunflower galaxy]] (M63) * [[Triangulum galaxy]] (M33) * [[Whirlpool galaxy]] (M51) (Grand Design spiral galaxy) * [[Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte]] (WLM) * [[NGC 6872]] (Condor Galaxy) * [[Malin 1]] (The largest known spiral or barred spiral galaxy) * [[Segue 2]] (One of the smallest known galaxies with only 1,000 stars.) * [[UGC 12158]] (A Milky Way twin) * [[Fireworks Galaxy]] (NGC 6946) * [[NGC 6744]] (Somewhat like the Milky Way) * [[NGC 1365]] (The Great barred spiral galaxy) * [[NGC 1232]] (A large intermediate spiral galaxy (A galaxy that is a bit of a normal spiral galaxy, but is also a bit of a barred spiral galaxy) * [[NGC 1316]] (Fornax A) * [[Rubins Galaxy]] (UGC 2885) * [[NGC 4889]] (Coma B) * [[NGC 4874]] (Coma A) * [[NGC 4921]] (An anemic spiral) * [[Messier 74]] (Phantom Galaxy) * [[NGC 3310]] * [[NGC 1566]] (The Spanish Dancer) * [[NGC 7603]] * [[NGC 7603 b]] * [[NGC 2403]] (Galaxy a bit like the [[Triangulum Galaxy]]) * [[NGC 6786]] (Galaxy interacting with LEDA 62867) * [[NGC 4911]] (Spiral galaxy near the central region of the Coma Cluster.) * [[NGC 6744 A]] (Satellite of NGC 6744 (See Above) * [[NGC 1232 A]] (Satellite of NGC 1232 (See Above) * [[NGC 1672]] (Galaxy with a large bar, around 20 Kiloparsecs across.) * [[Comet Galaxy]] ( Named after its unusual appearance due to it interacting with its home cluster.) * [[Abell 2261-BCG]] (A large Galaxy) * [[NGC 3982]] (Classic Spiral galaxy) * [[NGC 1073]] (Somewhat like the Milky Way in type) * [[NGC 3314 a]] (Overlaps NGC 3314 b (See below) * [[NGC 3314 b]] (Overlapped by NGC 3314 a (See above) * [[Messier 85 HCC1]] [Densest Galaxy Known as of 2015 , near Messier 85.) * [[Messier 59]] (Elliptical Galaxy in the Virgo Cluster) * [[Messier 99]] (Coma Pinwheel Galaxy) * [[Messier 88]] * [[Messier 106]] (A seyfert galaxy)  * [[NGC 5195]] (Galaxy interacting with the Whirlpool Galaxy ( See above ) * [[Messier 109]] * [[NGC 4490]] (Interacting with NGC 4485 (See Below) * [[NGC 4485]] (Interacting with NGC 4495 (See Below) * [[IC 4970]]-(Galaxy interacting with NGC 6872, stretching its arms.(See above)  == Related pages == *[[List of nearest galaxies]] *[[Most distant things]] *[[Local Group]] *[[IC 1101]]: the largest known galaxy, with about 100 [[trillion]] stars.<ref>https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/astro-ph/pdf/0209/0209205v2.pdf</ref><ref name=science250_4980_539>{{cite journal| author=Uson, Juan M. |display-authors = etal| title=The central galaxy in Abell 2029 {{ndash}} an old supergiant| journal=Science | volume=250 | issue=4980| pages=539&ndash;540| year=1990| doi=10.1126/science.250.4980.539| bibcode=1990Sci...250..539U }}</ref> *[[Galaxy]] == References == {{reflist}}   {{DEFAULTSORT:Galaxies}} [[Category:Galaxies|*]] [[Category:Astronomy lists]]</text>
