The name ''bubonic plague'' is specific for this form of the disease, which enters through the skin, and travels through the [[lymphatic system]].  The plague was spread by [[flea]]s on [[rats]]. That kind of disease is called a [[zoonosis]].  If the disease is left untreated, it kills about half its victims, in between three and seven days. The bubonic plague was the disease that caused the [[Black Death]], which killed tens of millions of people in Europe, in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/03/0310_040310_blackdeath.html|title=Bubonic plague traced to Ancient Egypt |first=Cameron|last=Walker|publisher=National Geographic News|date=10 March 2004|accessdate=2 April 2009}}</ref>  [[Symptom]]s of this disease include [[cough]]ing, [[fever]], and black spots on the [[skin]].  == Different kinds of the same disease == There are different kinds of Bubonic plague. The most common form of the disease is spread by a certain kind of [[flea]], that lives on [[rat]]s. Then there is an [[incubation period]] which can last from a few hours to about seven days.  === [[Septicemic plague]] === [[Sepsis]] happens when the bacterium enters the [[blood]] and makes it form tiny clots.  === Pneumonic plague === This happens when the bacterium can enter the lungs. About 95% of all people with this form will die. Incubation period is only one to two days.  === The abortive form === This is the most harmless form. It will result in a little [[fever]]. After that, there are [[antibody|antibodies]] that protect against all forms for a long time.  == History == The first recorded epidemic was in the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire)]], It was called the [[Plague of Justinian]] after emperor [[Justinian I]], who was infected but survived through extensive treatment.<ref>Little, Lester K.
