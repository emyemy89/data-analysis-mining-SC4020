<title>List of telescope types</title><text>[[File:Four VLT Unit Telescopes Working as One.jpg|thumb|300px|All Four [[VLT]] Unit Telescopes Working as One]]  [[Astronomy|Astronomical]] '''[[telescope]]s''' are divided into subgroups. All telescopes work by collecting [[electromagnetic radiation]] and [[focus]]sing it into an [[image]] which may be seen or [[photograph]]ed. The purpose is to see things which are far away in the [[universe]].  The traditional types all work to collect visible light from the sky. Recent types may work outside the visible [[spectrum]]. They all have their different advantages and disadvantages and they are used in different areas of astronomy.  == Optical == [[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-33225-0002, Berlin, Jugendstunde, Besuch einer Sternwarte.jpg|thumb|Large refractor]] [[File:Spiegelteleskop.jpg|thumb|Small reflector on altazimuth mount]] [[File:Komeetan thtitorni201205.jpg|thumb|Catadioptric telescope on fork mount]] === Refractors === Dioptrics. Telescopes which create their image with an [[Objective (optics)|objective]] that is a [[convex lens]] (refractors) are said to be "dioptric" telescopes. * [[Achromatic]]: uses convex and concave lenses together, to correct for chromatic aberration. ** [[Apochromatic]]: a more complex arrangement, for even less chromatic aberration. * [[Non-achromatic]] * [[Binoculars]]  === Reflectors === Catoptrics. Optical systems using mirrors: uses reflected light to form the image. * [[Newtonian telescope|Newtonian]] * [[Gregorian telescope|Gregorian]] * [[Cassegrain telescope|Cassegrain]] * [[Herschelian telescope]]  === Combined Lens-Mirror Systems === Catadioptric telescopes use corrector lenses to fix problems in a reflector. * [[Schmidt telescope]] * [[Maksutov telescope]]  == Outside the optical spectrum == {{See also|Electromagnetic spectrum}} * [[erenkov radiation]] telescope used to detect gamma rays * [[Infrared telescope]] * [[Radio telescope]] * [[Submillimeter telescope]] * [[Ultraviolet light]] telescope (for Ultraviolet astronomy) * [[X-ray]] telescope (for X-ray astronomy) **[[Wolter telescope]]  {{DEFAULTSORT:telescope types, List of }} [[Category:Telescopes|!]] [[Category:Astronomy lists]]</text>
