They were originally [[artificial selection|bred]] from [[wolf|wolves]]. They have been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated. There are different studies that suggest that this happened between 15.000 and 100.000 years before our time. The [[dingo]] is also a dog, but many dingos have become wild animals again and live independently of humans in the range where they occur (parts of [[Australia]]).  Today,  some dogs are used as [[pet|pets]], others are used to help humans do their work. They are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal and listen to humans. Thirty million dogs in the [[United States]] are [[wikt:register|registered]] as [[pet]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title= Family Flip Quiz Geography|last= Gifford|first= Clive|authorlink= |author2= Lisa Clayden |year= 2002|publisher= Miles Kelly Publishing|location= Bardfield Centre, Great Bardfield, Essex, CM7 4SL|isbn= 978-1-84236-146-7|pages= |url= }}</ref> Dogs eat both [[meat]] and [[vegetable|vegetables]], often mixed together and sold in stores as dog [[food]]. Dogs often have jobs, including as police dogs, army dogs, assistance dogs, fire dogs, messenger dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, or rescue dogs.  They are sometimes called "canines" from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for dog - ''canis''. Sometimes people also use "dog" to describe other [[canid]]s, such as [[wolf|wolves]]. A baby dog is called a '''pup''' or '''puppy'''. A dog is called a puppy until it is about one year old.  Dogs are sometimes referred to as "man's best friend" because they are kept as domestic pets and are usually loyal and like being around humans.  Dogs like to be petted, but only when they can first see the petter's hand before petting; one should never pet a dog from behind.  August 26 is National Dog Day.<ref>https://www.nationaldogday.com/</ref> While March 26 is National Puppy Day.<ref>https://nationaldaycalendar.com/national-puppy-day-march-23/</ref>  == Appearance and behaviour == Dogs have four legs and make a "bark," "woof," or "arf" sound. Dogs often chase [[cat]]s, and most dogs will [[wikt:fetch|fetch]] a ball or stick.  Dogs can smell and hear better than humans, but cannot see well in [[color]] because they are [[color blindness|color blind]]. Due to the anatomy of the eye, dogs can see better in dim light than humans. They also have a wider field of vision.  Like wolves, wild dogs travel in groups called [[pack (canine)|packs]]. Packs of dogs are ordered by rank, and dogs with low rank will submit to other dogs with higher rank. The highest ranked dog is called the [[alpha male]]. A dog in a group helps and cares for others. Domesticated dogs often view their owner as the alpha male.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RQ63-D3C9wcC&pg=PA52&dq=domesticated+dogs+view+owner+as+alpha+male&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwioxsSHuNfqAhWSUMAKHWIBDFIQ6AEwAXoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=domesticated%20dogs%20view%20owner%20as%20alpha%20male&f=false|title=Domestic Cats: Their History, Breeds and Other Facts|last=Robbins|first=Nancy|date=2012-02-14|publisher=Nancy Robbins|year=|isbn=978-1-4700-7538-5|location=|pages=52|language=en}}</ref>  == Lifespan == [[File:Dog and human year graph(fixed).png|thumb|This graph shows the correlation between weight and lifespan.]] Different dog breeds have different lifespans.

Breeds such as the [[Dachshund]] usually live for fifteen years, [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahuas]] can reach age twenty. The [[Great Dane]], on the other hand has an average lifespan of six to eight years; some Great Danes have lived for ten years.  == Origin of dogs == All dogs are descended from [[wolf|wolves]], by [[domestication]] and [[artificial selection]]. This is known because [[DNA]] [[genome]] [[wikt:analysis|analysis]] has been done to discover this.<ref>Lindblad-Toh K, Wade CM, Mikkelsen TS ''et al.'' 2005.

The earliest known [[fossil]] of a domestic dog is from 31,700 years ago in [[Belgium]].<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27240370 World's first dog lived 31,700 years ago, ate big] Jennifer Viegas, Discovery News, 10/17/2008</ref> Dogs have lived with people for at least 30,000 years. In 2013, a study was published that showed that the skull and teeth of a canid, dated to 33,000 years ago, had characteristics closer to a dog than to a wolf, and the authors conclude that "this specimen may represent a dog in the very early stages of domestication, i.e. an incipient dog."  The researchers go on to suggest that it was, however, a line that did not lead to modern dogs.<ref>Nikolai D.

[[Radiocarbon dating]] showed that the human bones were between 13.300 and 14.000 years old.  == Dogs and humans == Dogs are often called "man's best [[friend]]" because they fit in with human life. Man refers to humankind and not just guys ([[Old English]]). Dogs can serve people in many ways. For example, there are [[guard dog]]s, [[hunting dog]]s, [[Sheepdog|herding dogs]], [[guide dog]]s for [[blind]] people, and [[Police dog|police dogs]]. There are also dogs that are trained to smell for diseases in the human body or to find bombs or [[illegal drugs]]. These dogs sometimes help police in airports or other areas. Sniffer dogs (usually [[beagle]]s) are sometimes trained for this job. Dogs have even been sent by [[Russia]]ns into [[outer space]], a few years before any human being. The first dog sent up was named [[Laika]], but she died within a few hours.<gallery> File:A SAR dog of Iranian Red Crescent.jpg|A search and rescue dog searches for victims in the debris of a collapsed building in Tehran File:Sheep at watering place in Bulgaria.jpg|Dog herding sheep File:SVVP Klikat, pes schzejc schody.jpg|A guide dog File:Treibjagd0001.JPG|Many dogs are used for [[hunting]] Agents de scurit au dfil avec les chiens.jpg|Guard dogs in [[Cameroon]] </gallery>  == Dog breeds == [[File:Big_and_little_dog_1.jpg|thumb|200px|Dogs are bred into very different breeds: here a [[Great Dane]] and a small [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]].]] :''See also [[List of dog breeds]].'' There are at least 800 [[list of dog breeds|breeds]] (kinds) of dogs. Dogs whose parents were the same breed will also be that breed: these dogs are called [[purebred]] or pure [[pedigree]] dogs. Dogs with parents from different breeds no longer belong to one breed: they are called ''mutts'', ''[[mixed-breed dog]]s'', ''[[hybrid]]s'', or ''mongrels''. Some of the most popular breeds are sheepdogs, collies, [[poodle]]s and retrievers. It is becoming popular to breed together two different breeds of dogs and call the new dog's breed a name that is a mixture of the parents' breeds' two names. A puppy with a poodle and a pomeranian as parents might be called a Pomapoo. These kinds of dogs, instead of being called mutts, are known as designer dog breeds. These dogs are normally used for prize shows and designer shows. They can be guide dogs.  == Photogallery == <gallery> File:A Golden Retriever-9 (Barras).JPG|[[Golden Retriever]] File:Betty the Boxer.jpg|[[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]] File:Dob-3ans.jpg|[[Dobermann]] File:2 yr old Dalmatian.jpg|[[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] File:Briard 2 jaar.JPG|[[Briard]] File:Scottish terrier .jpg|[[Scottish Terrier]] File:Cachorro de Bichon Maltes.JPG|[[Maltese (dog)|Maltese]] File:Kurzhaardackel.jpg|[[Dachshund]] File:German Sheperd.jpg|[[German Shepherd]] File:Adult Black Pug.jpg|[[Pug]] </gallery>  ==Related pages== * [[The Puppy Bowl]]  == References == {{Reflist}}  [[Category:Dogs]]</text>
