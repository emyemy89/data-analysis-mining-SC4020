<title>1267</title><text>{{Year nav|1267}}  == Events ==  === By topic ===  ==== War and politics ==== * [[February 16]] &ndash; King [[Afonso III of Portugal]] and King [[Alfonso X of Castile]] sign the Badajoz Convention, figuring out the border between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the [[Kingdom of Leon]], and ensuring Portuguese sovereignty over [[Algarve]]. * [[May 27]] &ndash; [[Treaty of Viterbo]]: Emperor [[Baldwin II of Constantinople]] gifts the [[Principality of Achaea]] to King [[Charles I of Sicily]] in the hope that Charles can help him restore the [[Latin Empire]]. * The [[Second Barons' War]] in England ends, as the rebels and King [[Henry III of England]] agree to peace terms as laid out in the [[Dictum of Kenilworth]]. * [[Treaty of Montgomery]]: King [[Henry III of England]] acknowledges [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]]'s title of [[Prince of Wales]]. * The city of [[Ostrava]] is founded.  ==== Culture ==== * [[Roger Bacon]] completes his work ''Opus Majus'' and sends it to [[Pope Clement IV]], who had requested it be written; the work contains wide-ranging discussion of [[mathematics]], [[optics]], [[alchemy]], [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], and other topics, and includes what some believe to be the first description of a [[magnifying glass]]. Bacon also completes ''Opus Minus'', a summary of ''Opus Majus'', later in the same year. The only source for his date of birth is his statement in the ''Opus Tertium'', written in 1267, that ''"forty years have passed since I first learned the alphabet"''. The 1214 birth date assumes he was not being literal, and meant 40 years had passed since he matriculated at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] at the age of 13. If he had been literal, his birth date was more likely to have been around 1220. * The leadership of [[Vienna]] forces [[Jew]]s to wear ''Pileum cornutum'',a cone-shaped head dress, in addition to the [[yellow badge]]s Jews are already forced to wear. * In England, the [[Statute of Marlborough]] is passed, the oldest English law still (partially) in force.  === By place ===  ==== Asia and Africa ==== * The "Grand Capital" is constructed in [[Khanbaliq]] (present-day [[Beijing]]) by [[Kublai Khan]], having moved the capital of the [[Mongol Empire]] there three years prior. * [[Malik ul Salih]] establishes Samudra Pasai, the first [[Islam|Muslim]] state in [[Indonesia]]. * Spain attempts an invasion of [[Morocco]], but the [[Marinid]]s successfully defended against the invasion and drive out Spanish forces.  == Births == * [[February 3]] &ndash; [[Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel]] (d.
