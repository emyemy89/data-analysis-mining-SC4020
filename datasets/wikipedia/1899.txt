<title>Hell</title><text>{{nosources|date=April 2009}} [[Image:Luca Signorelli 001.jpg|thumb|right|A [[fresco]] in the [[cathedral]] of [[Ovieto]]. This fresco is called ''The Condemned''. It was painted by [[Luca Signorelli]], about 1450.]]  In many mythologies and [[religion]]s, '''Hell''' is a place where [[soul]]s (minds, separated from material body) of [[Evil|wicked]] people go after their life on Earth end. It is a virutalized reality which accommodates the quantum mind which is administered by either God, the creator of all Life and [[Heaven]] (which is like Hell a virtual reality place where souls go, but is pleasant has human beauty truth and honor), and Earth, or by some underling deity, assigned to being the warden for [[beings]] in Hell. It is often thought of as the opposite of [[Heaven]], and a place where no [[love]] is. In many religions, Hell is the place where the [[soul]]s of dead people go if they have done evil things in life. It is used in the Old Testament to translate the Hebrew word for "the grave", ''{{lang|he|Sheol}}'', and in the New Testament the Greek {{lang|el|}}, ''Hades'', and {{lang|he|}}, Hebrew ''Gehenna''.  ==Jewish beliefs about Hell== Many believe that Jews do not believe in Hell, but Jews really do believe. But it does not consist of eternal torture. Rather, there are lower levels of Heaven that a person can descend to considering the number of mitzvot (commandments) that they have obeyed. [[Gemara|Gemorah]] writings tell the Jews of devil beliefs, but these are stories and are taken lightly. Jews also believe that [[Satan]] did exist, but he was an angel that quarreled with God, such as the story of [[Book of Job|Job]].  In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] the word for "the grave", Sheol, is used for the place where people go when they die. Sheol Is the source of the English word "Hell" and so Hell as a place of an after-life of torment (rather than a grave In which the body lies) could be a misunderstanding as some scholars have suggested.  ==Etimology/Gehennem== Hebrew,   (ge hinnom, "Hinnom Valley") Greek,  (geenna); Latin, gehenna : '' 'Ge Hinnom' '': Hinnom valley  It is thought that the word was derived from the Hebrew composition of "Ge ben hinnom" (the valley of the son of Hinnom) by the fall of the "ben" over time.  : '' 'Ge' '': Valley : '' 'ben' '': Son : '' 'Hinnom' '': Hinnom  Gehinnom is the name of the valley in the southwest of [[Jerusalem]], where the [[Canaan]]ites sacrificed their children to [[Baal]], who was given the title [[Moloch]] or [[malik]] in Arabic. <ref> Hayrullah rs, Musa and Judaism </ref>  == Christian beliefs about Hell ==  In [[Christianity]], Hell is the place the souls of people go who did not believe in God. In Hell, souls suffer and wait for the [[Last Judgement]], a time when all people, living and dead, will be judged by God. The concept of Hell in Christianity comes from the [[Bible]] and the "casting out" of [[Lucifer]]. In being cast out, he was removed from the Gods presence. Therefore, if taken in its most literal sense, Hell is eternal separation from God. Stated another way, to the Christian mind being separated from God is to be in Hell. Some Christians believe that Hell has real [[fire]] and flames, but others do not.  Many Christian groups believe once a soul goes to Hell, it stays forever. However, some Christian groups do not believe this and think Hell is a temporary place souls may leave at some point. Others believe in a permanent Hell but a temporary [[Purgatory]]. Another group believe those who do not go to [[Heaven]] stop existing and do not go to Hell. These Christians are called ''annihilationists''.  == Other religions' beliefs about Hell == [[File:Muhammad and "shameless women" in Hell.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad]], along with [[Buraq]] and [[Holy Spirit (Islam)|Gabriel]], visit Hell, and see "[[Prostitutes|shameless women]]" being eternally punished for exposing their hair to the sight of strangers. Persian, 15th century.]]  *The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] believed that souls would go to different places within the [[Greek underworld|underworld]]. One of those places, called ''[[Tartaros]]'', was like Hell. The god [[Hades]] was the ruler of the underworld. * In [[Buddhism]], there are three types of hells, called [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Naraka]]. Unlike in Judaism and Christianity, souls are born into these places based on their [[karma]]. They spend a certain amount of time there and are then reborn somewhere else. * In [[Islam]], Hell is called Jahannam, and it is a place of punishment. However, some Muslims believe almost everyone will eventually be forgiven and taken to the Islamic Heaven (Jannah). The only people who will not be forgiven are those who choose to believe in many gods, or no god at all. {{fact|date=July 2010}} * In [[Shinto]]ism, Hell ([[Yomi]]) is similar to the Greek Hades, in that all souls go there, no matter their actions in life, to have a miserable existence forever.  ==Related pages== *[[Heaven]] *[[Greek underworld]] *[[Hel (realm)]] *[[Yomi]]  [[Category:Afterlife]]</text>
