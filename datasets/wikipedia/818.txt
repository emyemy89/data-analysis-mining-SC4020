<title>Wikipedia:General disclaimer</title><text>{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}} {{disclaimer-header}} __NOTOC__ <div style="text-align: center; font-size: x-large; padding: 1em;">WIKIPEDIA CAN BE WRONG</div>  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia on the Internet that is edited by anyone who wants to help. The way it works means that anyone with who can view the Internet can change what is written. When you read Wikipedia, you should remember that we cannot make sure that our information is checked by people who can make it complete, accurate or reliable.  That does not mean that there is not useful, correct information in Wikipedia; there is lots.  However, '''Wikipedia cannot make sure the information here is correct.''' Any article may have been changed or vandalized by someone who thinks they know what is correct, but is not aware of the current facts of the topics they are writing about.  === No system of checks by experts === We are developing ways to find versions of articles which are more correct, and show them to our readers. The people who help make Wikipedia use up-to-date lists like the [[Special:Recentchanges]] and [[Special:Newpages]] to watch new and changing pages. However, Wikipedia is not all checked by experts. Although readers might correct errors and some experts may [[Wikipedia:Peer review|check some articles]], they do not have a [[wikt:duty|duty]] to make changes. So, just because we have information here, this does not mean that we think it is all true, or useful for anything you want to do with it. We are not promising you that it is correct. Before you think that something might be correct, remember that ''all'' articles might have been badly changed to be wrong just before you see them, even ones that had - before - been [[Wikipedia:Peer review|check]]ed by experts or chosen as [[Wikipedia:Very good articles|''very good articles'']].  '''None of the editors, sponsors or administrators of Wikipedia, or anyone else connected with Wikipedia in any way at all can be responsible (their fault) for any information that is not correct. It is also not their fault if you use any of the information which is either at Wikipedia, or information on a page somewhere else which we have a web link to.'''  === No contract; limited license === Please make sure that you understand that the information provided here is being provided freely, and that no kind of agreement or contract is created between you and the owners or users of this site, the owners of the servers upon which it is housed, the individual Wikipedia contributors, any project administrators, sysops or anyone else who is in ''any way connected'' with this project or sister projects subject to your claims against them directly.
