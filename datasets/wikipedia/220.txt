<title>Human body</title><text>The '''human body''' is the [[body]] of a [[person]]. It is the physical structure of a person.  The body is a thing that can be hurt or killed. Its functions are stopped by [[death]]. You need your muscles and your joints to move.  == Study of the human body == [[File:Male template with organs.svg|alt=|thumb|the parts of digestion.]] Some people [[Research|study]] the human body. They look at where it is different from or the same as other [[animal]]s' bodies. These animals can be alive today. Or they can be [[extinct]] animals like other [[hominid]]s. (Hominids are [[primate]]s that are close to humans. [[Neanderthal]]s and ''[[Homo erectus]]'' were hominids.) Some people study how the human body works and lives in its [[environment]]. Some people study what people think about their body. Artists study how to draw or paint the human body.  == Fields of study == Many different fields of study look at the human: * [[Biology]] is a field of [[science]]. It studies living things. It looks at how the human body works. It studies how the human body came from [[evolution]]. It studies how [[genetics]] makes the human body. ** [[Anatomy]] studies the parts of the body and how they work together. ** [[Ecology]] studies the environment including how humans affect it. *[[Physical anthropology]] is a field of science.  It compares humans to other [[hominid]]s.  It also studies all other hominid bodies.  They look at how [[human]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s are the same or different. * [[Psychology]] is a field of [[medicine]]. It looks at how people think and feel. The [[brain]] is part of the body. How we think and feel comes from the brain. So psychologists study the body. They study how the brain lets us be who we are. * [[Religion]] also talks about the body. Some religions see the body as where the [[soul]] lives. Some see the body as like a [[church]]. This is because a church is where people [[worship]] [[God]]. These people think God should be worshiped inside people. Some religions think the body is made from [[chakras]] that connect us to the [[universe]]. * [[Medicine]] sees the body like a [[machine]].  [[Medical doctor|Doctors]] want to fix problems with the body.  They study how to fix the problems, called [[disease]]s.  Various [[organ system]]s give the body the ability to live and do things.  == The human body and other animals == The human body is like other animals. The [[skeleton]], [[muscle]]s and other parts are very much like those of other [[primate]]s. Our body is also like other [[mammal]]s, and somewhat like other [[vertebrate]]s. [[DNA]] differences follow a similar pattern. The [[human genome]] is closer to that of other primates than to other vertebrates, and closest to [[chimpanzee]].  == References == {{Reflist}}  [[Category:Anatomy]]</text>
