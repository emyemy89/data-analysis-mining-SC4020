<title>Airport</title><text>[[File:Heathrow LON 04 07 77.JPG|thumb|right|[[Heathrow Airport]] in [[London]] [[United Kingdom]]]] An '''airport''' is a place where [[airplane]]s can [[landing|land]] or [[wikt:take off|take off]]. Most airports in the world have only a long strip of level ground called a [[runway]]. Many airports have [[buildings]] which are used to hold airplanes and passengers. A building that holds passengers waiting for their planes or [[luggage]] is called a [[airport terminal|terminal]]. The sections between planes and the terminal are called "gates". Airports also have buildings called [[hangar]]s to hold planes when they are not used. Some airports have buildings to control the airport, like a control [[tower]] which tells planes where to go.  An '''[[international]] airport''' is a large airport that airplanes can use to [[flight|fly]] to and from other [[country|countries]]. A '''domestic airport''' is an airport which is usually smaller and only has airplanes coming from different places in the same country. Most international airports have [[shop]]s and [[restaurant]]s for airplane [[passenger]]s to use.  An airport used by the [[military]] is often called an '''air force base''' or '''airbase'''. An [[aircraft carrier]] is a [[wikt:float|float]]ing airbase.  == Safety == Airports are made and operated for [[safety]]. Today, people must walk through a [[metal detector]], a machine that can tell if metal goes through it. If it makes a noise, the officers will make that person take off all things on them that are metal. They also have [[X-ray]] machines that can look into [[luggage]]. If officers find items such as [[weapon]]s, or anything that can be used to kill people, that item (and the person who has it) are taken away and possibly arrested. As well as this, passengers are not allowed to bring bottles or containers with over 100 ml of liquid onto the plane because they could be turned into bombs. Therefore, all water bottles must be emptied before entering the secured area.  ==Related pages== * [[List of airports in Japan]]  == Other websites == * [http://www.airnav.com/airports/ AirNav.com] - complete list of U.S. airports, with detailed airport information * [http://flightwise.com/pu/ai/fa.aspx flightwise.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923135011/http://flightwise.com/pu/ai/fa.aspx |date=2010-09-23 }} - graphical airport finder via Google Maps * [http://www.fly.faa.gov/flyfaa/usmap.jsp ATCSCC Real-time Airport Status page] - shows airport delay times for major U.S. airports (FAA) * [http://www.flightcentral.net FlightCentral.net] - complete list of U.S. airports with detailed airport information and integrated weather * [http://www.dft.gov.uk Department for Transport] (United Kingdom) * [http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Government_Role/landing_nav/POL14.htm History of Aircraft Landing Aids] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118114307/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Government_Role/landing_nav/POL14.htm |date=2012-01-18 }} * [http://skyvector.com/ SkyVector.com] - Airspace and Airport information on Aeronautical Charts * [http://www.catsa-acsta.gc.ca/ Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) Official Website] * [http://www.airportlinger.com View airports and weather in Google Maps and Google Earth] * Float Incorporated (developers of floating airports and [[Pneumatic Stabilized Platform (PSP)]])  [[Category:Airports| ]]</text>
