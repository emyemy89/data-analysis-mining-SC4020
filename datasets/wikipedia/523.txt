<title>University</title><text>[[File:A lecture at the University of West London, Ealing Campus.jpg|thumb|280px|A lecture at the University of West London.]]  A '''university''' is a higher learning institution. The word ''university'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''universitas magistrorum et scholarium'', roughly meaning "community of teachers and [[academia|scholars]]". <ref>{{cite book| last = Chisholm| first = Hugh| title = Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information| url = https://books.google.com/?id=5vgGE8_CGOEC&pg=PA748| year = 1911| publisher = Encyclopaedia britannica Company| isbn = | page = 748 }}</ref> [[Student|Students]] can go to university to get an [[academic degree]]. Unlike the schooling they have done before, the courses at university are specialised. A person studying [[biology]] at university has many courses about biology and fewer courses in other fields such as languages or history. To get a higher degree, people must do some research.  Not all subjects are offered at universities. Mainly, universities offer courses which are about [[knowledge]]. They usually do not offer courses in practical trades. In some cases such as [[law]], where there are both knowledge and practical issues, the university does mainly the theoretical side of the subject. Practical qualifications are dome elsewhere.  == History == [[File:Bologna-vista02.jpg|thumb|280px|Old buildings of [[University of Bologna]], founded in 1088]] The universities were born in [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. The first institution of this type was the [[University of Bologna]], which later became a model for other centres of education<ref>{{cite book| last = Janin| first = Hunt| title = The University in Medieval Life, 1179-1499| year = 2008| publisher = McFarland| isbn = 978-0-7864-3462-6| page = 55 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Ridder-Symoens| first = Hilde de| title = A History of the University in Europe: Volume 1, Universities in the Middle Ages| url = https://books.google.com/?id=5Z1VBEbF0HAC| year = 2003| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-54113-8| pages = 4755 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Gaston| first = Paul L.| title = The Challenge of Bologna| url = https://books.google.com/?id=QUQ3mQEACAAJ| year = 2010| publisher = Stylus Publishing Llc| isbn = 978-1-57922-366-3| page = 18 }}</ref>.  At first, the universities had formed themselves according to the model of the professional groups and like almost everything in the Middle Ages, they remained tied to the [[Catholic Church]]. At the beginning, they had worked to teach the so-called "seven [[liberal arts]]" (the ''trivium'' and the ''quadrivium''): * ''Trivium'': [[grammar]], [[logic]] and [[rhetoric]]. * ''Quadrivium'': [[arithmetic]] and [[geometry]], [[astronomy]] and [[music]]. That earliest division caused the present divisions between literary and scientific fields. From one point of view, the world's oldest university is [[Qarawiyyin university]]. However, teaching religion is not the definition used by most people. A university should in theory teach every subject.  The university is generally regarded as a formal institution that has its origin in the [[History of Christianity|Medieval Christian]] tradition.<ref name="Regg, Walter 1992, pp. XIX">Regg, Walter: "Foreword.

In each campus there are several faculties and university schools (mainly for teaching), and also laboratories, departments and institutes of research. Many campuses also have housing for students in buildings called dormitories and structures like libraries, study rooms and gymnasiums for students that live there. Each school offers many courses that students take to earn a degree. The person with the highest right to control and to command in a university is the rector, who governs the university with the help of the party of vice-rectors and of other organs such as the social council and the governing body.  == Notable universities ==  ===[[Australia]]=== * The [[Australian National University]] * [[University of Melbourne]] * [[Deakin University]] * [[University of New South Wales]]  ===[[Canada]]=== * [[Carleton University]] * [[McGill University]] * [[McMaster University]] * [[Queen's University]] * [[University of British Columbia]] * University of New Brunswick * [[University of Ottawa]] * [[University of Toronto]] * [[University of Waterloo]] * [[University of Western Ontario]]  ===[[Chile]]=== * [[University of Chile]] (Universidad de Chile) * Catholic University of Chile (Universidad Catlica de Chile) * Metropolitan Technologic University (Universidad Tecnolgica Metropolitana)  ===[[China]]=== * [[Peking University]] * [[Tsinghua University]] * [[University of Hong Kong]]  ===[[Finland]]=== * bo Akademi University * Aalto University * University of Helsinki  ===[[Germany]]=== * [[Free University of Berlin]] * [[Goethe University Frankfurt]] * [[University of Tbingen]]  ===[[Italy]]=== * [[University of Bologna]]  ===[[Japan]]=== * [[University of Tokyo]] * [[University of Kyoto]] * [[Waseda University]] * [[University of Osaka]]  ===[[Malaysia]]=== * University of Malaya * [[Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman]]  ===[[Mexico]]=== * UNAM, [[Universidad Nacional Autnoma de Mxico]].
