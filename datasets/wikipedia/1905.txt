The Germans took over several countries, and the leaders of those countries went to England for [[refuge]].  Today, there are some governments-in-exile. They include:  *[[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] (SADR) in the [[Tindouf]] region in [[Algeria]] *the government of the [[Belarus National Republic]] exiled since [[1920]] and currently led by [[Ivonka Survilla]] in [[Canada]] *the government of the [[Dalai Lama]] in [[India]], claiming to be the real leaders of [[Tibet]], which was taken over by the Chinese *the former provinsional [[Government of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi government]] was exiled, claiming to be the real leaders of [[Bangladesh#History|East Bengal]] province, which was taken over by the [[Pakistani military]].
