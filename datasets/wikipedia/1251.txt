<title>Monarch</title><text>A '''monarch''' is the ruler of a [[monarchy]]. Monarchs usually rule because one of their relatives ruled. A [[male]] monarch can be a [[king]] or [[emperor]]. A female monarch can be called a [[queen]] or [[empress]].  Where rulers get their power by [[inheritance]] because they are a [[family]], they are a [[dynasty]]. Monarchs were very common in [[history]]. Many [[country|countries]] had a monarch in past centuries, but no longer have them. Some countries that still have monarchs have other [[leader]]s that actually have the power.  Monarchs tended to have monarchs of lower honour below them, e.g. a [[Empire]] could include several [[kingdom]]s, and a kingdom would have several duchies or principalities, nations would rarely include all titles, usually going from [[duchy]] to kingdom instead of duchy to principality to kingdom.  Prince/[[Princess]] means 'Ruler of a Principality' and 'son of king/queen'.  Some other languages have separate words for them.  {| class="wikitable" |- ! Title !! Male !!
