<title>Material</title><text>'''Material''' is what everything that you can touch is made of. Even material that is too small to touch, is called material. We use materials to make things. We can also call material "physical [[substance]]<nowiki/>s."  ''Raw'' material is materials such as [[ore]]s which we can clean and mix with other materials to make another material like steel, for example. [[Cotton]] is a raw material used to make [[textile]]<nowiki/>s, which are materials to make [[clothes]].  ==Some important materials== {{div col|cols=3}} * [[Metal]]s ** [[Steel]] ** [[Aluminum]] ** [[Copper]] ** [[Gold]] * [[Polymer]]s ** [[Rubber]] ** [[Plastic]] * [[Ceramics]] * [[Glass]] * [[Cement]] * [[Stone]] * [[Textile]]s ** [[Cotton]] fabric ** [[Wool]] fabric * [[organic]] materials ** [[Leather]] ** [[Bone]] ** [[Paper]] ** [[Lumber]]/[[wood]] ** [[Glue]] * [[Composite]]s ** [[Fiberglass]] ** [[Concrete]] {{div col end}}   {{stub}}  [[Category:Materials| ]]</text>
