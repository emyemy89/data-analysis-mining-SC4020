<title>Mathematics</title><text>{{more sources|date=July 2018}} [[File:Image-Al-Kitb al-mutaar f isb al-abr wa-l-muqbala.jpg|thumb|A page from al-Khwrizm's ''Algebra'']] Mathematics is the study of [[number]]s, [[shape]]s and [[pattern]]s. The word comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word "" (mthema), meaning "[[science]], [[knowledge]], or [[learning]]", and is sometimes shortened to '''maths''' (in [[England]], [[Australia]], [[Ireland]], and [[New Zealand]]) or '''math''' (in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/12/08/math_versus_maths_how_americans_and_brits_deploy_the_collective_noun.html|title=Why Do Brits Say Maths and Americans Say Math?|last=Waldman|first=Katy|date=2014-12-08|work=Slate|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}</ref> The short words are often used for [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]] or simple [[algebra]] by [[student]]s and their [[schools]].  Mathematics includes the [[Education|study]] of:  * Numbers: how things can be [[Counting|counted]]. *[[Structure]]: how things are [[organisation|organized]]. This subfield is usually called [[algebra]]. * Place: where things are and their arrangement. This subfield is usually called [[geometry]]. * Change: how things become different. This subfield is usually called [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]].  Mathematics is useful for solving [[problem]]s that occur in the real world, so many people besides [[mathematician]]s study and use mathematics. Today, some mathematics is needed in many jobs. People working in [[business]], [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[construction]] need some knowledge of mathematics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.siam.org/Students-Education/Programs-Initiatives/Thinking-of-a-Career-in-Applied-Mathematics|title=Thinking of a Career in Applied Mathematics? {{!}} SIAM|website=www.siam.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wigner|first=Eugene|date=February 1960|title=The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html|journal=Communications in Pure and Applied Mathematics|volume=13|pages=1-14|via=}}</ref>  == Problem-solving in mathematics == Mathematics solves problems by using [[logic]]. One of the main tools of logic used by mathematicians is [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]. Deduction is a special way of thinking to discover and prove new truths using old truths. To a mathematician, the reason something is true (called a [[Proof (mathematics)|proof]]) is just as important as the fact that it is true, and this reason is often found using deduction. Using deduction is what makes mathematics thinking different from other kinds of scientific thinking, which might rely on [[Experiment|experiments]] or on [[Interview|interviews]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/mathematics|title=The science checklist applied: Mathematics|website=undsci.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-08-05}}</ref>  Logic and reasoning are used by mathematicians to create general [[rule]]s, which are an important part of mathematics. These rules leave out [[information]] that is not important so that a single rule can cover many situations. By finding general rules, mathematics [[solution|solves]] many [[problem]]s at the same time as these rules can be used on other problems.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2016/08/21/role-generalization-advanced-mathematical-thinking/|title=The Role of Generalization in the Advanced Mathematical Thinking|date=2016-08-21|work=AMS Grad Blog|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en-US}}</ref> These rules can be called [[Theorem|theorems]] (if they have been proved) or [[Conjecture|conjectures]] (if it is not known if they are true yet).<ref>{{Cite book|title=How to Think Like a Mathematician|last=Houston|first=Kevin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|page=99|isbn=978-0-521-71978-0}}</ref> Most mathematicians use non-logical and creative reasoning in order to find a logical proof.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thurston|first=William|date=April 1994|title=On proof and progress in mathematics|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9404236.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=30|pages=161-177|arxiv=math/9404236|via=arXiv}}</ref>  Sometimes, mathematics finds and studies rules or ideas that we don't understand yet. Often in mathematics, ideas and rules are [[choice|chosen]] because they are considered simple or neat. On the other hand, sometimes these ideas and rules are found in the real world after they are studied in mathematics; this has happened many times in the past. In general, studying the rules and ideas of mathematics can help us [[knowledge|understand]] the world better. Some examples of math problems are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, calculus, fractions and decimals. [[Algebra]] problems are solved by evaluating certain [[variable]]s. A [[calculator]] answers every math problem in the four basic [[arithmetic]] operations.  == Areas of study in mathematics ==  === Number === :Mathematics includes the study of numbers and quantities.It is a branch of science that deals with logic of shape,quantity and arrangement. Most of the areas listed below are studied in many different fields of mathematics, including [[set theory]] and [[mathematical logic]]. The study of [[number theory]] usually focuses more on the structure and behavior of the integers rather than on the actual foundations of numbers themselves, and so is not listed in this given subsection.  :{| style="border:1px solid #999; text-align:center;" cellspacing="20" | <math>0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots</math> || <math> \ldots, -1, 0, 1,  \ldots</math> || <math>\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, 0.125,\ldots</math> || <math>\pi, e, \sqrt{2},\ldots</math> || <math> 1+i, 2e^{i\pi/3},\ldots </math>  |- | [[Natural number]]s || [[Integer]]s || [[Rational number]]s || [[Real number]]s || [[Complex number]]s  |- || <math>0, 1, \ldots, \omega, \omega + 1, \ldots, 2\omega, \ldots</math> || <math>\aleph_0, \aleph_1, \ldots</math> || <math>+,-,\times,\div</math> || <math> >,\ge, =, \le, < </math> || <math>f(x) = \sqrt x</math> |- || [[Ordinal number]]s || [[Cardinal number]]s || [[Arithmetic|Arithmetic operations]] || [[Arithmetic|Arithmetic relations]] || [[Function (mathematics)|Functions]], see also [[special functions]] |}  === Structure === :Many areas of mathematics study the structure that an object has.
