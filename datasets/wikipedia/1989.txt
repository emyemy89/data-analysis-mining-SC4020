Please do not change without discussion. -->) was an [[English people|English]] [[physicist]], [[mathematician]] and [[astronomer]]. He is well known for his work on the laws of [[motion (physics)|motion]], [[optics]], [[gravity]], and [[calculus]]. In 1687, Newton published a book called the ''[[Philosophi Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' in which he presents his theory of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]] and  [[Newton's laws of motion|three laws of motion]].<ref name="TIME">{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Peter|publisher=Time-Life Books|title=Age of Enlightenment|year=1966|pages=12, 18|chapter=The practical philosophers}}</ref>  Newton built the first practical [[Newtonian telescope|reflecting telescope]] in 1668. He also developed a theory of light based on the observation that a [[prism]] decomposes white light into the colors of the rainbow. Newton also shares credit with [[Gottfried Leibniz]] for the development of calculus.  Newton's ideas on light, motion, and gravity dominated [[physics]] for the next three centuries, until modified by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]].  == Life ==  === Early life === Isaac Newton was born (according to the [[Julian calendar]], in use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]] 4 January 1643) "an hour or two after midnight",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Newton,_Isaac|title=Isaac Newton, horoscope for birth date 25 December 1642 Jul.Cal|website=Astro-Databank Wiki|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref> at [[Woolsthorpe Manor]] in [[Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth]], a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in the [[county]] of [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]]. His father, also named Isaac Newton, died three months before his birth. When Newton was three, his mother, Hannah Ayscough, remarried with Reverend Barnabas Smith. Young Newton remained with his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough.  From 1655 to 1659, Newton was educated at [[The King's School]], [[Grantham]].<ref>"Newton the Mathematician" Z. Bechler, ed., Contemporary Newtonian Research(Dordrecht 1982) pp. 110111</ref> When he was seventeen, he was removed from school. His mother tried to make him a farmer, but he did not like that.{{sfn|Westfall|1994|pp=1619}} Henry Stokes, master at The King's School, requested his mother to send him back to school.{{sfn|White|1997|p=22}}  In June 1661, he was sent to the [[University of Cambridge]] to study. It is sometimes told that Isaac Newton was reading a book under a tree when an apple from the tree fell next to him. This led to his calculations of gravitation.  === Early discoveries === In 1666 Newton experimented with light, and found that different colours had different [[refraction]]<nowiki/>s. He began lecturing on this topic in 1670.  Newton explained the workings of the [[universe]] through [[mathematics]]. He described laws of motion and gravitation. These laws are math formulas that explain how objects move when a force acts on them. Isaac published his most famous book, Principia, in [[1687]]<ref name=TIME /> while he was a mathematics professor at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. In the Principia, Isaac explained three basic laws that govern the way objects move. He then described his idea, or theory, about gravity. Gravity is the force that causes things to fall down. If a [[pencil]] fell off a desk, it will land on the floor, not the ceiling. In his book Isaac also used his laws to show that the [[planet]]s revolve around the [[sun]]s in orbits that are oval, not round. Isaac also discovered [[diffraction]]. This led him to enter the field of physics, where he prospered.  ==== Newton's Three Laws Of Motion ==== {{Main|Newton's laws of motion}} Following are the three laws of motion. # The first law (Law of Inertia) #: Newton's first law of motion states is that an object that is not being pushed or pulled by some force will stay still, or will keep moving in a straight line at a steady [[speed]]. It is easy to understand that a [[rocket]] will not move unless something pushes or pulls it. It is harder to understand that an object will continue to move without help. Think of the rocket again. If someone is flying a rocket and jumps off before the rocket is stopped, what happens? The rocket continues on until it goes into space. The tendency of an object to remain still, or keep moving in a straight line at a steady speed is called [[inertia]]. # The second law (Law of Acceleration) #: The second law explains how a force acts on an object. An object [[accelerate]]s in the direction the force is moving it. If someone gets on a bicycle and pushes the pedals forward the bicycle will begin to move. If someone gives the bicycle a push from behind, the bicycle will speed up. If the rider pushes back on the pedals the bicycle will slow down. If the rider turns the handlebars, the bicycle will change direction. The formula showing this law is F=m*a, or the force acting on an object is equal to mass times acceleration. # The third law (Law of Reciprocal Actions) #: The third law states that if an object is pushed or pulled, the object will be push or pull equally in the opposite direction. If someone lifts a heavy box, they use force to push it up. The box is heavy because it is producing an equal force downward on the lifters arms. The [[weight]] is transferred through the lifters legs to the floor. The floor presses upward with an equal force. If the floor pushed back with less force, the person lifting the box would fall through the floor. If it pushed back with more force the lifter would fly into the air.  == The discovery of the Law of Gravitation ==  When most people think of Isaac Newton, they think of him sitting under an [[apple]] [[tree]] watching an apple fall. Some people even believe the apple fell onto his head. Newton understood that what makes things like apples fall to the ground is a specific kind of force  the force we call gravity. Newton thought that gravity was the force of attraction between two objects, such as an apple and the earth. He also thought that an object with more matter exerted the same force on smaller objects as they exerted on it. That meant that the large mass of the earth pulled objects toward it. That is why the apple fell down instead of up, and why people do not float in the air.  Isaac Newton went on thinking about gravity. Before Newton, people thought that only objects near to the earth would fall down. But Newton thought that gravity should not just be limited to the earth and the objects on it. What if gravity went to the [[moon]] and beyond?  Newton invented a formula for calculating the force of attraction between two bodies. He used it to calculate the force needed to keep the moon moving around the earth. Then he compared it with the force that made the apple fall downward. After allowing for the fact that the moon is much farther from the earth, and has a much greater mass, he discovered that the forces were the same. The moon is held in an orbit around the earth by the pull of earths gravity.  The formula invented by Newton is called the ''[[Law of gravitation]]''.  === Impact === Isaac Newtons calculations changed the way people understood the universe. No one had been able to explain why the planets stayed in their [[orbit]]s. What held them up? Less than 50 years before Isaac Newton was born it was thought that the planets were held in place by an invisible shield. Isaac proved that they were held in place by the suns gravity. He also showed that the force of gravity was affected by distance and by mass. He was not the first to understand that the orbit of a planet was not circular, but more elongated, like an oval. What he did was to explain how it worked.  Sir Isaac Newton was the first to discover  the laws of gravitation and the laws of motion. He also established a new field in mathematics known as [[calculus]], though the German [[Gottfried Leibniz]] had developed the ideas at the same time. His work has greatly contributed in the areas of science and mathematics making him one of the most influential scientists in human history and one of the greatest mathematician of all times.  The great physicist, [[Albert Einstein]], thought that Newton's idea of gravity was not completely accurate. He corrected many of the things that Newton did.  == Death == Isaac Newton died on {{OldStyleDateNY|{{death date|1727|03|31|1643|01|04|df=yes}}|20 March 1726}} in London, England.<ref name=TIME />  He is buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref name=TIME /> He set the stage for many famous physicists to come, such as Albert Einstein, [[James Chadwick]], and [[Stephen Hawking]].  == References ==  {{reflist}} {{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}} {{Reflist|group=note}} {{Wikiquote}}  == Other websites == {{Commons|Isaac Newton}} * [http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/newtoninvent.html What did Isaac Newton invent?]  {{Authority control}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Newton, Isaac}} [[Category:1643 births]] [[Category:1727 deaths]] [[Category:English mathematicians]] [[Category:English physicists]] [[Category:English science writers]] [[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]] [[Category:People buried in Westminster Abbey]] [[Category:Presidents of the Royal Society]] [[Category:Theoretical physicists]] [[Category:Writers from Lincolnshire]]</text>
