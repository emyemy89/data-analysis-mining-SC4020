<title>Chemical cell</title><text>A '''chemical cell''' converts [[chemical energy]] into [[electrical energy]]. Most [[battery|batteries]] are chemical cells. A [[chemical reaction]] takes place inside the battery and causes [[electric current]] to flow.  There are two main types of batteries - those that are ''rechargeable'' and those that are not.  A battery that is not rechargeable will give electricity until the chemicals in it are used up. Then it is no longer useful. It can be rightly called 'use and throw'.  A rechargeable battery can be ''recharged'' by passing electric current backwards through the battery; it can then be used again to produce more electricity. It was Gaston Plante, a French scientist who invented these rechargeable batteries in 1859.  Batteries come in many shapes and sizes, from very small ones used in toys and cameras, to those used in cars or even larger ones. [[Submarine]]s require very large batteries.  == Types of chemical cells == * Simple cell * [[Dry cell]] * [[Wet cell]] * [[Fuel cell]] * [[Solar cell]] * [[Electricity|Electric cell]]   == Electrochemical cells == An extremely important class ofoxidation and reductionreactions are used to provide useful electrical energy in batteries. A simple electrochemical cell can be made from copper and zinc metals with solutions of their sulphates. In the process of the reaction, electrons can be transferred from the zinc to the copper through an electrically conducting path as a useful electric current.  An electrochemical cell can be created by placing metallic electrodes into an electrolyte where a chemical reaction either uses or generates an electric current. Electrochemical cells which generate an electric current are calledvoltaic cellsor galvanic cells, and common batteries consist of one or more such cells. In other electrochemical cells an externally supplied electric current is used to drive a chemical reaction which would not occur spontaneously. Such cells are calledelectrolytic cells.  == Voltaic cells == Anelectrochemical cellwhich causes externalelectric currentflow can be created using any two different metals since metals differ in their tendency to lose electrons. Zinc more readily loses electrons than copper, so placing zinc and copper metal in solutions of their salts can cause electrons to flow through an external wire which leads from the zinc to the copper. As a zinc atom provides the electrons, it becomes a positive ion and goes into aqueous solution, decreasing the mass of the zinc electrode. On the copper side, the two electrons received allow it to convert a copper ion from solution into an uncharged copper atom which deposits on the copper electrode, increasing its mass. The two reactions are typically written<center> Zn(s) --> Zn<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + 2e<sup>-</sup> </center><center> Cu<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + 2e<sup>-</sup>--> Cu(s) </center>The letters in parentheses are just reminders that the zinc goes from a solid (s) into a water solution (aq) and vice versa for the copper. It is typical in the language of electrochemistry to refer to these two processes as "half-reactions" which occur at the two electrodes. {| class="wikitable" |<center> Zn(s) -> Zn<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + 2e<sup>-</sup> </center> | {| class="wikitable" |The zinc "half-reaction" is classified asoxidationsince itloses electrons.

The metal ions themselves must be prevented from moving between the electrodes, so some kind of porous membrane or other mechanism must provide for the selective movement of the negative ions in the electrolyte from the right to the left.  Energy is required to force the electrons to move from the zinc to the copper electrode, and the amount of energy per unit charge available from the voltaic cell is called theelectromotive force (emf)of the cell. Energy per unit charge is expressed involts(1 volt = 1 joule/coulomb).  Clearly, to get energy from the cell, you must get more energy released from the oxidation of the zinc than it takes to reduce the copper. The cell can yield a finite amount of energy from this process, the process being limited by the amount of material available either in the electrolyte or in the metal electrodes. For example, if there were onemoleof the sulfate ions SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>on the copper side, then the process is limited to transferring two moles of electrons through the external circuit. The amount ofelectric chargecontained in a mole of electrons is called the Faraday constant, and is equal toAvogadro's numbertimes the electron charge:<center>Faraday constant = F = N<sub>A</sub>e = 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup>x 1.602 x 10<sup>-19</sup>= 96,485 Coulombs/mole</center>The energy yield from a voltaic cell is given by the cell voltage times the number of moles of electrons transferred times the Faraday constant.<center> Electrical energy output = nFE<sub>cell</sub> </center>The cell emf E<sub>cell</sub>may be predicted from thestandard electrode potentialsfor the two metals. For the zinc/copper cell under the standard conditions, thecalculated cell potentialis 1.1 volts.  ==Simple cell== [[File:Pila voltaica.jpg|thumb|150px|Simple cell]] A simple cell typically has plates of [[copper]] (Cu) and [[zinc]] (Zn) in dilute [[sulphuric acid]]. The zinc dissolves and bubbles of [[hydrogen]] appear on the copper plate. These hydrogen bubbles interfere with the passage of current so a simple cell can only be used for a short time.  To provide a steady current, a [[depolarizer]] (an [[oxidizing agent]]) is needed to oxidize the hydrogen. In the Daniel cell, the depolarizer is [[copper sulphate]], which exchanges the hydrogen for copper. In the [[Leclanche battery]], the depolarizer is [[manganese dioxide]], which oxidizes the hydrogen to [[water]].  == Daniel cell == [[File:Daniel cell.png|thumb|150px|Diagram of a Daniel cell]] English chemist John Frederick Daniell developed avoltaic cellin 1836 which used zinc and copper and solutions of their ions.  ;Key * Zinc rod = negative terminal * H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = dilute sulphuric acid electrolyte * Porous pot separates the two liquids * CuSO<sub>4</sub> = copper sulphate depolarizer * Copper pot = positive terminal   [[Category:Chemistry]] [[Category:Energy]] [[Category:Batteries]]</text>
