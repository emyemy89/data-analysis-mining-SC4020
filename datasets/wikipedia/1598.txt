<title>Angle</title><text>[[Image:Angle_Symbol.svg|120px|thumb|right|An angle.]]  When two [[Straight|straight]] lines come together, they make an '''angle'''. The two lines are called the ''[[side]]s''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5r_7DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA16&dq=called+%22sides+of+an+angle%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi3lJG1p9LqAhXJTMAKHe1BAAoQ6AEwAnoECAkQAg#v=onepage&q=called%20%22sides%20of%20an%20angle%22&f=false|title=The Teacher of Geometrical Drawing - For High Schools, Manual Training Schools, Technical Schools, Etc|last=Campana|first=D.

A flat surface (called a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]) also forms an angle when it meets another.  To represent an angle, [[Greek letter|Greek letters]] such as <math>\alpha</math> ([[alpha]]), <math>\beta</math> ([[beta]]), <math>\gamma</math> ([[gamma]]) and <math>\theta</math> ([[theta]]) are sometimes used.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-03-01|title=Compendium of Mathematical Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/|access-date=2020-08-17|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}}</ref> An angle indicates the space between its sides, or the amount of rotation needed to make one side coincide the other.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Definition of angle {{!}} Dictionary.com|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/angle|access-date=2020-08-17|website=www.dictionary.com|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|title=Angle|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Angle.html|access-date=2020-08-17|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en}}</ref>  To measure the [[size]] of an angle, we use [[Unit of measurement|unit]]s called [[Degree (geometry)|degrees]]. A degree is a standard unit and we use the [[symbol]]  after a number to show that it is a number of degrees. We can use a [[Decimal|decimal number]] or a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] for part of a degree, but a degree can also be divided into 60 [[minute]]s (1 = 60'), and a minute can be divided into 60 [[second]]s (1' = 60"). So 22.5, 22{{Fraction|1|2}} and 22 30' are all the same angle.    In [[mathematics]], angles can also be (and often are) measured in [[radian]]s instead of degrees, by using the conversion factor <math>2\pi\mbox{ rad} = 360^\circ</math> (for example, <math> 22.5^\circ = \tfrac{\pi}{8}\mbox{ rad}</math>). Yet another unit of angle is gradian,<ref name=":0" /> with  <math> 100 \text{ grad} = 90^{\circ}</math>.   Angles are studied in [[geometry]], where an angle where [[edge]]s meet is often called a [[vertex]]. For example, the three sides of a [[triangle]] are its ''edges'' and two of the edges meet at each ''vertex''. Similarly, two of the six sides (or ''faces'') of a [[cube]] meet at each of its twelve edges, and three edges meet at each of its eight [[corner]]s (or [[wikt:vertices|vertices]], which is the plural version of ''vertex''). ==Types of angles==  In a zero angle the lines lie one upon the other thus creating a 0 angle aka the [[zero angle]]. An angle greater than 0 but less than 90 is called an [[acute angle]]. An angle of 90 is called a [[right angle]]. An angle greater than 90 but less than 180 is called an [[obtuse angle]]. An angle that measures 180 is called a [[straight angle]]. An angle greater than 180 and less than 360 is called a [[reflex angle]]. An angle that has a made or full circle/ completed 360 is called a [[ full or complete angle]]. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Angles - Acute, Obtuse, Straight and Right|url=https://www.mathsisfun.com/angles.html|access-date=2020-08-17|website=www.mathsisfun.com}}</ref>  [[wikt:supplementary angles|Supplementary angles]] are two angles with the [[sum]] [[equal]] to 180, and [[complementary angles]] are two angles with the sum equal to one [[right angle]] (90). On the other hand, two angles that sum to one full [[circle]] (360) are sometimes called [[wikt:explementary|explementary]] angles, or [[wikt:conjugate|conjugate]] angles.  People usually use a [[protractor]] to measure and draw angles. Sometimes, people use a [[360 protractor]] to measure angles.  == Related pages ==  * [[Sun angle]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  [[Category:Angles| ]] [[Category:Geometry| ]] [[Category:Mathematics| ]] [[Category:Basic English 850 words]]  {{wiktionary}} {{Math-stub}}</text>
