The symbols must be known to others, so that the [[text]] may be [[read]].  A text may also use other visual systems, such as [[illustration]]s and decorations. These are not called writing, but may help the message work. Usually, all educated people in a country use the same [[writing system]] to record the same language. To be able to read and write is to be [[literacy|literate]].  Writing differs from [[speech]] because ''the readers need not be present at the time''.  We can read writing from long ago, and from different parts of the world.<ref name=Ong>Ong, Walter J. 1982. ''Orality and literacy: the technologizing of the word''.

Writing is one of the greatest [[invention]]s of the human species. It was invented after people settled in [[town]]s, and after [[neolithic revolution|agriculture started]]. Writing dates from about 3,300<small>BC</small>, which is over 5000 years ago, in the [[Middle East]].  Writing today is usually on [[paper]], though there are ways to print on almost any surface.   [[Television]] and [[movie]] [[screen]]s can also display writing, and so can computer screens.  Many writing materials were invented, long before [[paper]]. [[Clay]], [[papyrus]], [[wood]], [[slate]] and [[parchment]] (prepared animal skins) have all been used. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] wrote on [[Wax tablet|waxed tablets]] with a pointed [[stylus]]; this was popular for temporary notes and messages.  The later invention of paper by the [[China|Chinese]] was a big step forward.<ref name="Robo">Robinson. Andrew 1995. ''The story of writing''.

More and more, however, [[text]] is created by input on a [[computer keyboard]].  == Definition of writing == There are two schools of thought:<ref name=DeF>DeFrancis, John 1989. ''Visible speech: the diverse oneness of writing systems''. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press. Chapter 1 and Chapter 6.</ref>  *''Partial writing'': Writing is any system of graphic symbols which conveys ''some'' thought.  *''Full writing'': Writing is any graphic system which can convey ''any and all'' thought.<ref name=DeF/><sup>p5</sup>  Therefore, depending on an author's definition of writing, the term may be used in different ways. With many early systems we do not know what they do convey. The central idea is that ''a full writing system must be able to represent anything that might be said in spoken language''.<ref name=DeF/><sup>p7, 217</sup> From this point of view the invention of the [[rebus]] is an essential step.<ref>A rebus is an existing symbol, such as a pictogram, used just for its sound, to represent a word. Many ancient writing systems used the rebus concept to represent abstract words, which otherwise would be hard to represent by pictograms.</ref>  We can only be sure a sign system is full writing if we can translate the symbols into a modern language. In the case of some ancient scripts we cannot do this.  == History of writing == Writing was invented independently a number of times. The [[Sumer]]ian, the [[ancient Egypt]]ian, the [[China|Chinese]] and the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] writings are separate in their invention.<ref name=Ong/><ref>Some authorities have suggested that Egyptian hieroglyphs arose from Sumeriam writing. There is no direct evidence for this, and their scripts and methods of writing are entirely different.</ref><sup>p85</sup> All these writing systems started with ''pictographs'', symbols that stood for things. Then they developed a mixture of methods. Our own [[alphabet]]ic system  is different. It is based on the sounds of [[speech|spoken]] language. All alphabets are modified versions of the first one, which originated with the [[Phoenicians]] and the [[Ancient Greeks]].  === Sumer === [[File:AmarnaLetterOfMarriageNegotiation-BritishMuseum-August19-08.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Letter negotiating a marriage ~1350 BC. It is from Tushratta, King of the Mitanni, to the pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]]]]  The [[Sumer]]ians lived in [[Mesopotamia]],<ref>Meaning 'between the rivers'.</ref> between the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers. 5000 years ago this was a fertile region and is now mostly in [[Iraq]]. The Sumerians developed a form of writing called [[cuneiform]].<ref>'Cuneus' being [[Latin]] for 'wedge', hence cuneiform = wedge-shaped.</ref> [[Triangle|Triangular]] marks were pressed into soft clay tablets. After the clay had dried in the sun the tablets were [[bake]]d. Then they were carried somewhere else for others to read. We know that its first uses were for [[trade]], [[accounting]] and [[administration]].  The earliest signs were mostly [[picture|pictorial]], but soon they stood as symbols for objects, ideas and sounds. This writing system was extremely successful, and outlasted the Sumerian empire. It was then used by other civilisations in the Middle East, such as the Old  [[Akkad]]ian, [[Babylon]]ian, [[Assyria]]n, [[Elamite]], [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Persian Empire|Old Persia]]n and [[Ugar]]itic [[empire]]s. The last cuneiform inscription was dated as <small>AD</small>75. Thus the system had lasted for more than 3000 years.<ref name="Robo"/><sup>p71</sup> Each version of cuneiform had to be deciphered separately, because all the languages were different. Documents (including stone objects) written in more than one language provided the clues.  === Ancient Egypt === [[File:Egypt-Hieroglyphs.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hieroglyphs on stone; Ramses II statue behind]] This is the most famous of the old forms of writing, or ''scripts''. It was invented at roughly the same time as cuneiform, yet was quite different in style, and used different materials. [[Ancient Egypt#Writing|Egyptians]] ended up with three writing systems for the same language. They were: :1. [[Hieroglyph]]ic: the famous pictorial language on stone monuments. :2. Hieratic: a cursive  ('running') script used by the priests. :3. Demotic: a cursive script used by the people.  The [[writing tool]]s used varied according to the material which was written on. The two cursive scripts were written with [[Reed (plant)|reed]] [[pen]]s and [[carbon]] [[ink]]s onto [[papyrus]]. If the material was [[cloth]], then the writing was done by a brush. Many examples survive. The hieroglyphs were inscribed (carved) into stone ([[hammer]] & [[chisel]]) or [[paint]]ed onto stone surfaces. Many survive, some with the original colours intact. The key event in the decipherment of hieroglyphic writing was the discovery of the [[Rosetta Stone]]. This is a [[granite]] slab with the same message written in hieroglyphic, demotic and in Greek. Ancient Greek is well understood, and made possible the interpretation of the other two scripts.  === Chinese === Chinese is the language with the largest number of native speakers. Its history dates back to about 1400<small>BC</small>.<ref name="Robo"/><sup>p183</sup> The Chinese writing system is idio-syllabic, a mixed method using characters which may have one or more of these elements: :1. Pictographic: representing objects. :2. Visual logic: the number '3' is three horizontal strokes. :3. Complex logic: the sun is a box with a horizontal mid-stroke. :4. Rebus: "sounds like..." the character for [[wheat]] is also used for 'come' because the words are ''homophonous'' (sound alike). :5. Semantic-phonetic: combination of a character for meaning with another for sound (pronunciation). [[Image:Hanzi.svg|thumb|right|These are [[Chinese character]]s. The black are in [[traditional Chinese]], and the red are in [[simplified Chinese]].]]  Chinese has a huge number of characters: in the region of 50,000.<ref name="Robo"/><sup>p186</sup> Because of this, [[printing]] methods were never really successful in China, despite their early invention. In the 14th century Wang Tzhen had sixty thousand wood block characters cut, a huge investment in time and money. He printed 100 copies of a local gazette, and was author of a treatise on agriculture and other technical works. Even with printing machines from Europe in the 19th century, the process was hampered by the huge number of characters, which slowed the ''composition'' to a snail's pace.<ref>Composition: the arrangement of the individual characters on a frame for the purpose of printing.</ref>  China has eight regional languages that are mutually unintelligible, and many true dialects. The system appears to work mainly because as many as 70% speak [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]]. Fluency in Chinese reading and writing is undoubtedly difficult to achieve, and this must act as a brake on the drive for [[literacy]]. There have been a number of attempts to reform or simplify the system. The most radical in [[Pinyin]], which is a program to replace Chinese characters with an alphabetic system. This was supported by [[Mao]], but faltered after his death.  == Alphabets == [[File:Causa 10.jpg|thumb|13th century calligraphy & illustration]]  It seems that the idea of an alphabeta script based entirely upon soundarose only once, and has been copied and adapted to suit many different languages. Although no alphabet fits its language perfectly, it is flexible enough to fit any language approximately. It was a unique invention.<ref>Man, John 2000. ''Alpha Beta: how our alphabet shaped the western world''. Headline, London.</ref><sup>p12</sup>   Our alphabet is called the [[Roman alphabet]], as compared with the [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] and other alphabets. All of these come from the ancient [[Greek alphabet]], which dates back to about 1100 to 800<small>BC</small>.<ref name="Robo"/><sup>p167</sup> The Greek alphabet was probably developed from the Phoenician script, which appeared somewhat earlier, and had some similar letter-shapes.  The [[Phoenician language]] was a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]], often called Canaanite. The Semitic group of languages includes [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Maltese, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and also [[Aramaic]], the language spoken by [[Jesus]]. We do not know much about how the alphabetic idea arose, but the Phoenicians, a trading people, came up with letters which were adapted by the early Greeks to produce their alphabet. The one big difference is that the Phoenician script had no pure [[vowels]]. Arabic script has vowels which may be shown by [[diacritic]]s (small marks above or below the line).<ref>The modern practice in printed Arabic is not to use diacritics</ref> The oldest Qu'ran manuscripts had no diacritics.<ref>enWP Arabic diacritics</ref> [[Israeli]] children today use texts with vowel 'dots' added, to about the third grade.<ref name=Ong/><sup>p89</sup>  No ancient script, alphabetic or not, had pure vowels before the Greeks. The Greek alphabet even has two vowels for 'e' and two for 'o', to distinguish between the long and short sounds.<ref>Short 'e' is  ''epsilon'', long 'e' is  ''eta''. Short 'o' is o ''o micron''; long 'o' is  ''o mega''. Languages other than Semitic have copied the Greek or Roman alphabets, making such changes as seem right for their particular language.</ref> It is fairly clear from this that careful thought went into both the Phoenician invention and the Greek adaptation. However, no details survive of either process.<ref name="Diri"/>  Semitic scripts apparently derive from ''Proto-Sinaitic'', a script of which only 31 inscriptions (plus 17 doubtful) are known. It is thought by some researchers that the original source of this script was the Egyptian hieratic script. By the late Middle Kingdom (about 1900<small>BC</small>) hieratic had added some alphabetic signs for representing the [[consonant]]s of foreign names. Egyptian activity in Sinai was at its height at that time.<ref>Sass B. 1988. ''The genesis of the alphabet, and its development in the 2nd millenium''. Wiesbaden.</ref> A similar idea had been suggested many years before.<ref>Gardiner, Alan 1916. The Egyptian origin of the alphabet. ''J. Egyptian Archaeology'' III.</ref>  == Undeciphered scripts == There are a number of scripts which have never been deciphered,<ref>Decipher: to [[translate]] an unknown text into a known language.</ref> despite much effort.<ref Name="Robo"/><sup>p145</sup> Perhaps the most famous are the script of the [[Indus Valley civilization]], and [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]].<ref>The meaning of about 200 Etruscan words are known in Etruscan, and the alphabet is fairly well understood. [http://www.mysteriousetruscans.com/language.html]</ref> The [[Indus River]] civilisation predates other literate civilisations on the Indian subcontinent, going back to about 2500<small>BC</small>. Their cities of Mohenjo-Daru and [[Harappa]] were well-planned, with good drainage. The script is found on seal stones,<ref>Stones used for making a personal mark.</ref> [[terracotta]],<ref>Earthenware</ref> [[bronze]], [[bone]] and [[ivory]]. All are brief, and the language is unknown.  The Etruscan language used Greek letter-forms, and is found mainly on Etruscan [[tomb]]s, from [[Tuscany]] through to [[Venice]]. They were an empire before the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], who defeated them, and absorbed their ideas. All knowledge of their language was lost, except that some of the names on tomb memorials can be read from the Greek letters.  === Vina symbols === [[File:Tartaria_amulet_retouched.PNG|thumb|left]] The '''Trtria tablets''' are three [[clay tablet|tablets]] discovered in 1961 in the village of [[Trtria]] ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: Alstatrlaka).

In 1908 similar symbols were found during excavations, by Miloje Vasi (18691956) in Vina. This is a suburb of [[Belgrade]] ([[Serbia]]), some 300&nbsp;km from Turda. Later, more were found in another part of Belgrade. Since 1875 over one hundred and fifty Vina sites have been found in Serbia alone. Many, including Vina itself, have not been fully excavated.

In many other parts of the world this did not happen until the 20th century. Until then, [[literacy]] was mainly for [[Clergy|cleric]]s, that is, people who had training as [[priest]]s. Even wealthy people were often illiterate, and used [[scribe]]s to write for them. The invention of [[printing]] came before mass literacy. Before 1500, each [[book]] had to be created by hand, so there were few books available compared to the billions in the world today. Mass literacy needed cheap books.   Even now, there is still widespread illiteracy.<ref>The [[UN]] estimated that, in 1998, about 16% of the world's population were illiterate.</ref>  == Handwriting == The ordinary use of writing by means of a [[pen]] and [[paper]]. Can refer to writing for oneself, as in a [[diary]], but mostly it refers to sending [[letter]]s. Once it was almost the only means of communication between people who were separated. Now, the [[telephone]] and [[e-mail]] are the most common means of distance communication.  ==Related pages== *[[Writing system]] *[[Calligraphy]] *[[Printing]]  == References == {{commonscat}} {{Reflist}}  [[Category:Basic English 850 words]] [[Category:Writing| ]] [[Category:History of technology]]  [[kk:]]</text>
