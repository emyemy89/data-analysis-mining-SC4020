It shares [[border]]s  with [[Afghanistan]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iraq]], [[Pakistan]], [[Turkey]], and [[Turkmenistan]].  [[Tehran]] is the [[Capital (city)|capital]] and biggest [[city]]. Iran is the eighteenth largest country in the world. It has more than 84.9 million people. Iran has been a member of the [[United Nations]] since 1945. It is a member of the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC).<ref>http://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml</ref> It is an [[Islamic republic]].  In Iran, Persians, Azerbaijanis, Kurds, Mazandaranis, Gilaks, Lurs and Bakhtiaris make up the nations minority ethnic groups.  == History == {{main|History of Iran}} In the past, Iran was called "Persia" by people outside of the [[country]]. The people that lived there called the country "Iran". The official name was Persia, a region in Iran. The name Persia was used when dealing with other countries and in [[government]] papers.  In 1935, [[Reza Shh Pahlavi]] was [[Shah]] of Iran. He officially asked foreigners to call the country "Iran". This was done to show that Iran belongs to all the non-Persian Iranians as well as to Persian Iranians. The name Iran means ''land of the [[Aryan]]s''. It is used in the ancient book of the [[Zoroastrian]]s, the [[Avesta (religious scripture)|Avesta]]. In the 19th and early 20th century, the name ''Aryan'' was used by [[Europe]]ans to mean ''all [[Indo-European people|Indo-European]]s''.  The "Aryan Race" was a term that [[Adolph Hitler|Hitler]] used to describe his "Superior" or "perfect" race, but it first meant Iranians.<ref>Norton, 2002</ref> "Aryan" means "noble" in Iranian languages.  === Persian Empire ===  Around 500 BC, the area that is now Iran was the center of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city states fought against the Persian armies led by [[Darius the Great]] and [[Xerxes]]. Then [[Alexander the Great]] took the country by fighting the Achaemenid dynasty of [[Persia]]. He ruled until he died,then the Greek Seleucids ruled until they were defeated by the Parthian Empire which later fought the [[Roman Empire]].  After the Parthians, the Sassanian dynasty (224-651) took over. Other people took Persia by [[war|fi\ghting]], like the [[Arab]]s (7th century), [[Turkic peoples|Turk]]s (10th century) and [[Mongols]] (13th century).  However, Iran has always had a different [[culture]] and continued to survive.  === After World War II === {{further|Islamic Revolution}} The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) worked in Iran to create 1953 [[riot]]s which led to the removal of [[Prime Minister]] Mosaddegh. The [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]] then made the [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] the most powerful person in Iran, again. The Shah left Iran in 1979 in the face of a revolt. The Iranian [[government]] was changed to an [[Islamic Republic]] by [[Islamic Revolution]].  Soon afterwards, the [[Iranian Students Movement]] (Tahkim Vahdat), with the backing of the new [[government]], took over the [[U.S.]] [[Embassy]] in [[Tehran]]. They held most of the [[diplomat]]s [[hostage]] for 444 days.  Relations between the two countries have not been good since. For example, the [[United States]] claims that Iran supports [[terrorist]] [[group]]s against [[Israel]]. Iran does not see Israel as a country. Iran, along with most [[Arab]] countries, believes that Israel does not have the [[Rights|right]] to exist. However, Iran has collaborated with the West at times. These deals have been about energy or about fighting terrorism.  Iran fought the [[IranIraq War]] in the 1980s.  Many foreign countries supported Iraq.  Now, the [[Western world|West]] is trying to prevent Iran from using [[Nuclear engineering|nuclear technology]], even though Iran is a member of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) has reported many times that there is no evidence that Iran is developing [[nuclear weapon]]s. However, it also says that it can not say for sure that Iran is not doing so in [[secret]].  A December 2007 [[CIA]] report on nuclear activity in Iran said that Iran's [[secret]] program to get nuclear [[weapon]]s [[technology]] was stopped in 2003. It said that Iran will probably not be able to build a nuclear [[weapon]] soon.  == Economy == Iran has the [[natural resource]] of [[Petroleum|oil]]. It is a member of OPEC. Oil is one of its main exports. [[Rice]], handicrafts, [[carpet]]s and [[crocus]] are important local products. Iran is the world's largest exporter and producer of [[caviar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russiran.com/en/iranian-products/foods/caviar.html|title=Caviar|publisher=Russia-Iran.com|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}</ref> Iran is also one of the world's biggest exporters of pistachio nuts.  Iran has factories that produce industrial products. Iran is also involved in the field of biomedical sciences.  [[Rial]] is the [[money]] used in Iran.  == Religion in Iran ==  About 90% of Iranian people are [[Muslim]]. The [[state religion]] is [[Shia Islam]].  It has been the state religion since the [[Safavid dynasty]] in the 16th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mark W. Janis, Carolyn Maree Evans|title=Religion and International Law|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=8CxMFjU12OUC&pg=PA381|page=381|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|year=1999|isbn=9789041111746}}</ref> This is the religion of about 75% of Iranians.<ref name="cia"> {{cite web | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html | title = CIA - The World Factbook -- Iran | accessdate = 2008-04-18 | author = U.S. Central Intelligence Agency | date = 2008-04-15 | publisher = U.S. Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref> They belong to the [[Twelver]] branch. About 9% of Iranians Muslim belong to the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] branch of Islam.
