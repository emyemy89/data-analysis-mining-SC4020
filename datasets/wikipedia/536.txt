<title>World Wide Web</title><text>{{unsourced|date=February 2012}} :''"The Web" redirects here. For other uses, see [[Web (disambiguation)]]''.  The '''World Wide Web''' ("'''WWW'''" or "'''The Web'''") is the part of the [[Internet]] that contains [[website]]s and [[webpage]]s. It was invented in 1989 by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]], [[Geneva City|Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].  Sir Tim Berners-Lee created a new [[markup language]] called [[HTML]].  Websites are composed of pages linked by [[hypertext]] links that are written in HTML.  The software to see the World Wide Web is called a [[web browser]]. One also needs a connection to the [[Internet]].   Many companies nowadays offer limited [[Web hosting service|website hosting]] allowing one to make websites that can be displayed on the World Wide Web like any other [[Domain name|domain]] (www.stuff.com) site. These sites usually make money from [[advertisement]]s instead of [[fee]]s.  ==Related pages== *[[Minitel]]   {{tech-stub}} {{authority control}} [[Category:Internet]]</text>
