It was founded on 1 October 1949. It currently has more than 1.4 billion [[people]] (as of 2017), which is more than any other country in the [[world]].<ref name="Census2010" /> It covers an area of 9.6 million [[square kilometers]].  The capital city is [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]] is the city with the most people living in it. Along with the cities of [[Tianjin]] and [[Chongqing]], these four cities are "[[municipality|municipalities]]" directly controlled by the national government. Two other cities are given the status of "[[Special Administrative Region|special administrative region]]" (SAR). They are [[Hong Kong]], which was once a [[colony]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and given back to China in 1997 and [[Macau]], which [[Portugal]] gave back in 1999. These two cities remain highly [[Autonomy|autonomous]] or have much of their own power. Aside from the "municipalities" and the "SARs", there are 23 [[province]]s and five "[[Autonomy|autonomous regions]]" or regions with more law-making rights than the provinces and with many people of a [[minority group]] population. They are the [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]], the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] or Xizang Autonomous Region, the [[Guangxi|Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region]], the [[Inner Mongolia|Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region]] or Nei Mongol Autonomous Region and the [[Ningxia|Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region]].  In the SARs, the central government is responsible for defense and [[Foreign policy|foreign affairs]] but not the daily operations for 50 years. PRC claims [[Taiwan]] as one of its many provinces. However, PRC does not have control of [[Taiwan]] which has an entirely different [[political]] system and officially known as the [[Republic of China|Republic of China (Taiwan)]].  == History == {{see also|History of China}} <!-- since we don't have a History of the PRC article--> China has one of the world's oldest civilizations and has the oldest continuous civilization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emsc.nysed.gov/ciai/socst/grade3/whatisa.html|title=What Is a Culture?|author=|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-06|archive-date=2010-01-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107133436/http://www.emsc.nysed.gov/ciai/socst/grade3/whatisa.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> It has [[Archaeology|archaeological]] evidence over 5,000 years old.<ref name="Hagg2">{{cite book| last = Haggett| first = Peter| title = Encyclopedia of World Geography| year = 2002| publisher = Cavendish Square| isbn = 978-0-7614-7289-6| page = 37 }}</ref> It also has one of the world's oldest [[Chinese character|writing systems]] (and the oldest in use today), and is viewed as the source of many major [[inventions]].<ref name="Hagg2" />  === Ancient (2100&nbsp;B.C. - 1500 A.D.) === [[Ancient China]] was one of the first [[civilization]]s and was active since the [[2nd millennium BC]] as a [[Feudalism|feudal]] [[society]].

A.D. 10th century).  Home of  [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]], it had great influence on nearby countries including [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Vietnam]] in the areas of political system, philosophy, religion, art, and even writing and literature. China is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world. Statues and pottery, as well as decorations made of [[jade]], are some classic examples.  Before the [[Qin Dynasty]] united China, there were hundreds of small states that fought each other for hundreds of years in a war to control China. This is known as the [[Warring States Period]]. Although the continuing wars made people suffer, it was at this time when many of the great [[Eastern philosophy|philosophies of the East]] were born, including [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]]. Confucianism and Daoism alone have been the foundation of many social values seen in modern eastern-Asian cultures today.  Its geography mostly looked like that of modern China, except with northern and western edges that varied. It was often attacked by northern [[nomadic people]] such as the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]] and the [[Mongol]]s lead by [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Kublai Khan]]. During the history of ancient China, the northern nomadic people and the Chinese people had been fighting each other and taking turns to rule the land and the people of China. However, when the northern people beat the Chinese people and came to rule the kingdom, they also Incorporated the Chinese way of living and became like the Chinese. Many of the strongest dynasties of China were ruled by the northern people, including the [[Qing Dynasty|Qin]], [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] (Mongolian), and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] ([[Manchu]]). Each time, they also brought new elements into the Chinese culture.  === A new age === While China achieved many things in the [[First millennium]] and early [[2nd millennium]], it became an [[Isolationism|isolationist]] country in the [[15th century|15th century C.E.]] This was because Spain found a lot of silver in the newly explored [[continent]]s of [[Americas|North and South America]]. Silver was the main currency (money) in China and Europe at the time, and China did not want to be bought by the foreigners.  By the time of the [[Renaissance]], European powers started to take over other countries in Asia. During this time the opium epidemic was growing in China. Foreign traders (primarily British) had been illegally exporting opium mainly from India to China since the 18th century, but that trade grew dramatically from about 1820. The resulting widespread addiction in China was causing serious social and economic disruption there.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Opium-Wars|title=Opium Wars {{!}} Definition, Summary, Facts, & Causes|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en}}</ref> This led to what is now known as the first opium war. The first '''Opium''' '''War''' between China and Great Britain lasted from 1839 to 1842. The conflict was the result of years of attempts by the British to exploit China as a market for British goods. Britain eventually relied on its superior military capabilities to force open the lucrative Chinese market, while imposing an illicit trade in '''opium''' on the Chinese people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=4&sid=b130205c-e02d-49f3-8e9b-a56daad94c2b@sdc-v-sessmgr06&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#db=elr&AN=19543804|title=Opium War (1839): Background: .Discovery Service for Indiana Univ Northwest|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-03}}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  While China was never actually taken over by Europeans, many [[Europe]]an [[countries]], such as [[Britain]] and [[France]] built [[spheres of influence]] in China.  Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few [[centuries]], by the [[Qing Dynasty]], it had fallen behind other countries in [[technology]], and was helpless to stop this from happening.  This had become clear when it lost the [[Opium Wars]] to [[Britain]] in the [[19th century]].  In 1912, the Qing dynasty was overthrown by the [[Sun Yat-sen]] and the [[Kuomintang]], a [[nationalist]] party, and the [[Republic of China]] established. Over time, [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideas grew popular and the [[Communist Party of China|Communist party]] was formed.  The [[Chinese Civil War]] later started between the [[Kuomintang]] (Nationalists) of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) and the Communists of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Communists wanted to make China like the [[Soviet Union]], whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time. The Communists were led by [[Mao Zedong]], [[Zhou Enlai]], [[Liu Shaoqi]] and others. Later Liu lost influence with Mao and his death to this day remains unresolved. The Communists eventually won the war. The Nationalists (led by Chiang Kai-shek) fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei. After the Chinese Civil War, the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country, the People's Republic of China (PRC), in [[Beijing]] on October 1, 1949.<ref name=prcfounding/><ref name=prcf2/><ref name=prcf3/>  In 1927, the [[Chinese Civil War]] began as the Kuomintang, led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]], and the Communists fought one another.  Amidst the turmoil brewing between the Nationalist and Communist parties who were vying for control of China at the time, Japan had launched an invasion of Manchuria in 1934 and began to creep steadily inland.  China, the Nationalist party in particular, owed Japan immense amounts of money, which they could not pay whilst infused in their own civil war. The Treaty of Versailles promised the Japanese government land in China in return for forgiveness of their debt. This ended up not being a popular sentiment and was rallied against all over the country, and most famously during the May 4th Movement in Beijing in 1919. When the Chinese did not readily give up their rights to their land, Japan tried to take it by force. This was the beginning of World War II in the Pacific Theater.<ref>Mitter, Rana. Modern China: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press inc. 2008</ref>  By 1949, the [[Red Army]] of the Chinese Communist Party had gained control over [[mainland China]] and [[Mao Zedong]] announced the creation of the People's Republic of China. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the other nationalists fled to [[Taiwan]].[[File:China, Mao (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Mao Zedong]] founding the People's Republic of China in 1949]]  As the [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party]], Mao began many social and economic reform projects with mixed results. The [[Great Leap Forward]], from 1958 to 1961, tried to [[industrialization|industrialize]] China and increase its food production, but resulted in one of the largest [[famine]]s in history. It is estimated that 45 million people died as a result of this reform project.<ref name="Akbar2010">{{cite news|url =https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html |title= Mao's Great Leap Forward 'killed 45 million in four years'|accessdate=26 March 2013 |work=The Independent |location=London |first=Arifa|last=Akbar|date=17 September 2010}}</ref> In 1966, Mao began the [[Cultural Revolution]] to remove [[capitalism|capitalist]] influences from society and government. Major government officials and ordinary citizens were accused of being "revisionists" - people who disagreed with some parts of Marxism - or "counter-revolutionaries" and were [[persecution|persecuted]]. Many universities and schools were closed, and historical and religious sites were destroyed. Although the program officially ended in 1969, it continued until Mao's death in 1976.  During this time period, the People's Republic of China did not get along with the [[capitalist]] countries of the [[Western world]]. Beginning in the 1960s, relationships between the People's Republic of China and the [[Soviet Union]] also became increasingly unfriendly in the [[Sino-Soviet Split]]. In 1972, to counter the power of the Soviet Union, Chairman Mao and Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] met with US President [[Richard Nixon]] in Beijing. This began to improve relationships between China and the Western world.  After Mao's death, there was a power struggle between the [[Gang of Four]] and Chinese Premier [[Hua Guofeng]], the man Mao had chosen to be the next leader of China. Eventually, [[Deng Xiaoping]], one of the [[veteran]]s of the revolution, took power. He began a "Reform and Opening Up" ({{Lang-zh|s=|t=}}) campaign. These reforms tried to make the People's Republic of China a modern, industrial - but still socialist - nation by moving towards a [[market economy|market system]]. Deng's policies would be known as "socialism with Chinese characteristics."  Although Deng's policy helped loosen restrictions on citizens, the People's Republic of China continues to have problems with the amount of control the government has over citizens' private lives. In 1979, the [[one-child policy]], which limits most couples to one child, was created because of the [[overpopulation]] problem in the People's Republic of China. This policy is highly [[controversy|controversial]] and many Westerners have criticized it. News and Internet sites are also [[censorship|censored]] by the government.  In 1989, the Chinese Communist Party used soldiers and tanks to stop a [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|protest in Beijing's Tiananmen Square]] organized by students seeking political reform. This action received worldwide criticism and led to [[economic sanction]]s being placed on the Chinese government.  In [[August]] 2008, China hosted the [[Summer Olympics]] for the first time.  == Geography == {{see also|List of cities in the People's Republic of China}} The People's Republic of China is the third-<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/countries-in-world-by-area/|title=Largest Countries in the World by Area 2019}}</ref> or fourth-largest<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-largest-countries-in-the-world-the-biggest-nations-as-determined-by-total-land-area.html|title=The Largest Countries in the World|author=|website=WorldAtlas}}</ref> country in the world after [[Russia]], [[Canada]], and (in some sources) the [[United States]] and the second-largest by land area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/geography/largest-countries-in-the-world/|title=Largest Countries in the World by Land Area - Worldometers|author=|website=www.worldometers.info}}</ref> China has every kind of climate in the northern hemisphere except the [[polar climate]].

Nowadays PRC is among the atomic powers in the world. It also has the largest standing army in the world of over 2 million soldiers on active duty.  == People and culture == There are 56 recognized [[ethnic group|ethnic minority groups]] in [[China]]. [[Han]] is the largest ethnic group in China. [[Mandarin Chinese]] is the main spoken language.  China is the origin of Eastern [[martial art]]s, called [[Kung-fu|Kung Fu]] or [[Wushu]]. China is also the home of the well-respected [[Spa Monastery]] and [[Wudang Mountains]]. Martial art started more for the purpose of [[survival]], defense, and [[war]]fare than [[art]]. Over time some [[art form]]s have branched off, while others have retained their distinct Chinese characteristics.  China has had renowned [[artist]]s including [[Wong Fei Hung]] and many others. [[Art]] has also co-existed with a variety of [[paint]]s including the more standard 18 colors. Legendary and controversial moves like [[Big Mak]] are also praised and talked about within the [[culture]].  China has many traditional [[festival]]s, such as the [[Chinese New Year]], Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival and so on. The most significant is [[Chinese New Year]]. Another important holiday is the [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]] celebration around October.  Weekends are moved around to make sure everyone has a week-long holiday for it, just like during the lunar new year.  ===Festivals=== [[Chinese New Year]] lasts fifteen days, including one week as a [[national holiday]]. It starts with the first day of the Chinese lunar year and ends with the full moon fifteen days later. It is always in the middle of winter, but is called the Spring Festival in Chinese because Chinese seasons are a little different from English ones. On the first day of the Chinese New Year, people call on friends and relatives. Because most people watch the special performances on [[China Central Television|CCTV]] all the night on New Year's Eve and don't go to bed until 12:00&nbsp;AM, they usually get up later in the next day. The fifth day of the Chinese New Year is the day to welcome the god of Wealth (Chinese:), many people make and eat dumplings (Chinese:.  Pinyin: Jaozi). They believe that dumplings can hold the god of Wealth and bring luck.  The last day of the Chinese New Year is the Lantern Festival. On this day, the moon becomes the full moon. People go out and watch the lantern festivals everywhere. After that, they eat sweet dumpling (Chinese:,), a kind of dumpling which is round and looks like the full moon.  Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet of the State of Chu during the [[Warring States]] period. He persuaded his emperor not to accept Qin's diplomats's offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him. He was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life. The people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse. They made and threw rice dumplings into the river. They hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poet's corpse. They also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish.  Eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races, became what the Chinese do in this festival nowadays.  Held on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, the Mid-Autumn Festival is a festival for families. Now when the festival sets in, people sit together to eat moon cakes, appreciate the moon and the moon itself, celebrate the bumper harvest, and enjoy the family love and happiness. To the Chinese people, the full moon symbolizes family reunion, as do the moon cakes. Hence why the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Family Reunion Festival.  == Transport == [[Train]]s are commonly used for moving from one place to another, mainly for long distances. [[Bullet train]]s are faster and more common in the cities. China has more high-speed trains than any other country in the world. [[Bus]]es and [[air travel|air transport]] are also very common.  ==Related pages == * [[List of provinces of China]] * [[Political problems of China]]  ==Notes== {{notelist}}  == References == {{reflist}}  == Other websites == * {{En icon}} [http://www.china21th.net.ms/ Information, Links, History  and more of China ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115134824/http://www.china21th.net.ms/ |date=2009-11-15 }} * {{En icon}} [http://www.china-map-guide.com/ China Maps] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512205759/http://www.china-map-guide.com/ |date=2013-05-12 }} * {{commons-inline}} * {{wikivoyage-inline}}  {{Asia}}  [[Category:People's Republic of China| ]]</text>
