<title>Silk</title><text>[[File:Meyers b14 s0826a.jpg|thumb|Four of the most important domesticated silk worms, together with their adult moth forms, [[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]] (1885-1892)]] '''Silk''' is a natural [[fibre]] made by the [[silk worm]] cocoon. Silk fibres are very strong and are often used to make [[cloth]]. The [[Ancient China|Chinese]] invented silk in 3000 [[BC|B.C.]] and [[trade]]d it across the world through the [[Silk Road]] because it was very valuable and costly .  The cloth from silk can be made into  [[rug]]s, [[bed]]ding, or can be used to [[writing|write]] or [[painting|paint]] on. In the past, silk was used to make [[parachute]]s. The practice of growing silkworms for silk production is called ''sericulture''.  Most [[spider]]s make a natural fibre of their own that is also called silk.  ==Chemical properties== Silk that is made by the silk worm is made up of two main [[protein]]s, [[sericin]] and [[fibroin]].  Fibroin is the structural center of the silk and gives it its [[Strength of materials|strength]]. It is made up of [[amino acid]]s, which make the [[fiber]]s strong and hard to break. The [[tensile strength]] is there because of [[hydrogen bond]]s. When silk is stretched, there is a strong [[Force (physics)|force]] on these many bonds, so they do not break.  Serecin is the sticky material which surrounds the fibroin and gives it protection from the outside. Silk is resistant to most [[mineral acid]]s, except for [[sulfuric acid]], which dissolves it. [[Perspiration]] gives the silk a [[yellow]]ish colour.  ==Related pages== {{commonscat|Silk}} * [[Silk Road]]  {{-}} {{stub}}  [[Category:Basic English 850 words]] [[Category:Fibers]] [[Category:Cloth]]</text>
