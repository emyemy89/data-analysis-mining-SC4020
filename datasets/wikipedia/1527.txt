People most remembered him today for his conflict with the [[Catholic Church]] of his day, which led to his trial for [[heresy]] by the [[Inquisition]].  == Life ==  Galileo was born on 15 February 1564 in [[Pisa]], [[Florence|Duchy of Florence]]. He was the eldest of five [[sibling]]s. His father was Vincenzo Galilei, who was a scholar and a musician.  In 1574, the Galileo family moved to Florence and he started his formal education in the Camaldolese monastery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/galileo-9305220#synopsis|title=Galileo|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref> === Astronomy === Some people{{Who|date=June 2019}} believe that Galileo was the first person to build a [[telescope]]. This is not true, but he was the first person to [[publish]] his [[observation]]s of [[astronomical object]]s through a telescope.<ref>{{cite book| last = Sharratt, Michael 1994| first = Michael| title = Galileo: decisive innovator| year = 1996| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-56671-1| pages = 12| ref = Reference-Sharratt-1994 }}</ref> He discovered that the [[Milky Way]] is made of many stars.<ref name="TIME">{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Peter|year=1966|title=The practical philosophers, in ''Age of Enlightenment''|publisher=Time-Life Books|pages=16, 18}}</ref> He discovered that the Moon has [[hill]]s.<ref name="TIME" /> He found four moons around [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]].<ref name="TIME" /> Those moons are now called the [[Galilean moons]]. He discovered [[sunspot]]s,<ref name="TIME" /> which are dark areas of the [[Sun]]. He saw that the planet [[Venus]] has light and dark phases just like the [[Moon#Phases|Moon]]. This helped people to know that the Sun is at the centre of the Solar System, as [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] had said.  === Physics === Galileo worked more at physics than at astronomy. He studied natural forces, and was one of the most important discoverers of the part of [[physics]] that is now called [[kinematics]], including the discovery of the kinematic [[principle of relativity]]. However, he is often remembered now for things that either did not happen, or failed.  A [[legend]] says that he climbed the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]], and dropped [[cannon]]balls of different weights, to see which would strike the ground first. Even though their weights were not the same, they hit the ground at the same time. Galileo found that objects fall to the ground at the same rate, unless things like [[wind resistance]] change the rate. This went against the views of [[Aristotle]], an ancient [[philosopher]] whose [[theory]] was different. Galileo's findings were ignored by most people, and Aristotle's view was still accepted as correct until [[Isaac Newton]] proved Galileo was right. This also led to Newton creating his Law of [[Gravity]].  Galileo also tried to [[wikt:Determine|determine]] the [[speed of light]]. He climbed a hill, and had an assistant climb another hill, both carrying [[lantern]]s with closed shutters. He then opened the shutter of his lantern. His assistant opened his own shutter when he saw Galileo's lantern. Galileo then measured the time it took for his assistant's shutter to open. Knowing the time difference, and the distance between the hills, he tried to [[estimate]] the speed of light. However, this did not work.<ref>Gamow, George 1988.

Venice 1610. Discovery of 'new worlds' with the [[telescope]]. * ''Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo, Tolemaico et Copernicano''. Florence, 1632. The famous 'dialogue between two world systems, [[Geocentrism|Ptolemaic]] and [[Heliocentrism|Copernican]]'. * ''Discorsi et demonstrazioni mathematiche, intorno a due nuove scienze''. (discourses and mathematical demonstrations relating to two new sciences) Leiden 1638. This, on [[kinematics]], a non controversial subject, was written when Galileo was under house arrest, and published in Holland, out of the Inquisition's territory.  === Trial for heresy === [[File:Galileo facing the Roman Inquisition.jpg|thumb|220px|left|]] Galileo came to accept the findings of Copernicus, that the [[Sun]] was the center of the then-known universe, and not the [[Earth]]. Because he [[promote]]d this and other ideas, he came to the notice of the Committee of Propaganda, the dreaded [[Inquisition]]. The Church taught that the Earth stood still, while everything in the sky moved around it. The Inquisition ruled in 1616 that other theories could only be discussed as possibilities, not facts. Galileo said he would obey. He played a major part in the scientific revolution through this argument.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/galileo-9305220|title=Galileo|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-13}}</ref>  Galileo later discussed the question in his most famous work, ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'', published in 1632 by permission of the Inquisition. His scientific writing was usually in Latin for hundreds of scientists around Europe, but this was one of the books he wrote in Italian so thousands of Italians could read it. The book was in the form of conversations between three men. The man representing the Church's point of view was called 'Simplicio'.  Church leaders who liked his earlier books were angry at this one. The Inquisition took action in 1633. He was arrested and put on trial. They found him "[[:wikt|vehemently]] suspect of [[heresy]]". They reminded him of the fate of [[Giordano Bruno]], who had been burnt at the stake for heresy on topics such as [[transubstantiation]] and the [[Trinity]]. Bruno also believed the Earth went round the Sun and stars had planets. The Inquisition forced Galileo to recant (say he was wrong) under the threat of [[execution]], and to withdraw his works from publication. Galileo spent the last ten years of his life under [[house arrest]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Galilei| first = Galileo| title = Galileo on the World Systems: A New Abridged Translation and Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ewKMpRsF4Y8C&pg=PA47| year = 1997| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-91822-1| page = 47 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Hilliam| first = Rachel| title = Galileo Galilei: Father of Modern Science|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KBKSyHOLzZAC&pg=PA96| year = 2005| publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group| isbn = 978-1-4042-0314-3| page = 96 }}</ref> Galileo continued to write about physics and other topics, but not astronomy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://solar-center.stanford.edu/galileo/|title=Galileo's Discoveries  400th anniversary|website=solar-center.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-03-13}}</ref>  Galileo has become synonymous with a warrior for scientific truth. Although he had to retract his writings at his trial,it is widely believed that after the trial he insisted that Earth does move around the sun, saying the famous phrase "''[[And yet it moves|Eppur si muove]]'''  ''still it moves.'' The saying itself became a slogan for science.  == Death == Galileo Galilei died on {{death date and age|8 January 1642|15 February 1564|df=yes}} in [[Arcetri]], [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], [[Italy]].<ref name="JoCarney">{{cite book| last = Carney| first = Jo Eldridge| title = Renaissance and Reformation, 15001620: a| year = 2000| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 0-313-30574-9 }}</ref><ref>{{Catholic Encyclopedia |wstitle=Galileo Galilei |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06342b.htm |prescript= |year=1909 |inline=1 | first=John |last=Gerard}}</ref>  Previously, he was buried in a small room next to the novices' chapel at the end of a [[corridor]].<ref name="burial spot">[[#Reference-Shea&Artigas-2003|Shea & Artigas (2003, p. 199)]]; [[#Reference-Sobel-2000|Sobel (2000, p. 380)]].</ref> Later, he was reburied in the main body of the basilica in 1737 after a monument had been built there in his honour.<ref name="reburial spot">[[#Reference-Shea&Artigas-2003|Shea & Artigas (2003, p. 200)]]; [[#Reference-Sobel-2000|Sobel (2000, pp. 380384)]].</ref>  == Related pages == * [[Giordano Bruno]] * [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] * [[Johannes Kepler]] * [[List of science books#17th century|List of science books of 17th century]] * [[Speed of light]] * [[MichelsonMorley experiment]]  == Notes == {{notelist}} == References == {{reflist}}  == Bibliography == {{Commons category}} * {{cite book|title= Galileo: a very short introduction.|author= Drake, Stillman  2001 |ref=Reference-Drake-2001}} * {{cite book|title= Galileo: the man, his work, his misfortunes|author= Brodrick, James S.J.|publisher= Chapman|year= 1965|location= London|ref=Reference-Brodrick-1965}}  {{Authority control}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Galilei, Galileo}} [[Category:1564 births]] [[Category:1642 deaths]] [[Category:Italian astronomers]] [[Category:People from Pisa]] [[Category:Italian physicists]]</text>
