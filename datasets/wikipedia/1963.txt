About half of the country's people live in its capital city, [[Seoul]], or near the city in the [[metropolis|metropolitan]] area. Korea's Seoul metropolitan area is one of the most [[population|populous]] metropolitan areas in the world. In fact, some sources say it is the second most populous after [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=3_4whicharethe.pdf (application/pdf )|url=http://www.uic.edu/cuppa/cityfutures/papers/webpapers/cityfuturespapers/session3_4/3_4whicharethe.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040804123321/http://www.uic.edu/cuppa/cityfutures/papers/webpapers/cityfuturespapers/session3_4/3_4whicharethe.pdf|archive-date=August 4, 2004|accessdate=9 July 2010|work=uic.edu}}</ref>  == History== South Korea's history began with Dangunwanggeom's Gojoseon. Gojoseon was conquered by [[Han dynasty|Han China]]. After Gojoseon collapsed, there were a lot of countries such as Buyeo, Okjeo, Dongyae and Samhan. But Baekje, Goguryeo and Silla were the strongest. So their period began, and it is called the Three Kingdoms Period. Goguryeo and Baekje were conquered by Silla and Dang China's allied forces, and Silla unified the three kingdoms. There was another country, Balhae. Balhae was founded by Dae Jo-Young. Later Silla and Balhae's period is called South and North Countries Period. A rebellion in Later Silla caused the birth of a new nation: Goryeo, which was founded by Wanggeon. Mongolia's invaded Goryeo. Near the end of the Goryeo period, there was a great general Lee Seong-Gye. The king of Goryeo directed him to occupy Yodong, but he opposed. However, Lee Seong-Gye went to Yodong to occupy it, but he returned to Goryeo and he revolted. His revolt succeeded, and he founded the country Joseon. Joseon's first king, Taejo, moved the capital to Hanyang (Seoul). Joseon's fourth king, [[Sejong the Great|Sejong]], made the Korean alphabet, ''Hangeul''. Joseon's twenty-second king, Jeongjo, built Hwaseong Fortress in Suwon. Joseon's twenty-sixth king, Gojong, changed the country's name to Daehanjeguk. When Daehanjaeguk's power weakened, Japan [[Occupied territory|occupied]] it for 35 years until Japan's defeat in [[World War II]] in 1945. In 1950, there was a big war, the [[Korean War]]. As a result, Korea was split into two countries, North and South.  ==  Geography == South Korea is in [[East Asia]], [[border]]ing [[North Korea]], and is surrounded by water on three sides, as it makes up the southern part of the [[Korea]]n [[peninsula]]. It is separated from [[Japan]] by the [[Sea of Japan]](East Sea). South Korea is mainly [[mountain]]ous, and there are many islands off the south coast. The [[capital city]], [[Seoul]], is quite close to the North Korean border. The largest island is [[Jeju-do|Jeju Island]] and the highest mountain is [[Hallasan]], on Jeju. The country is slightly smaller than [[Iceland]] and [[Virginia]].  == Politics and government == South Korea is a [[democracy]], meaning that people can vote for their [[government]]. The [[President of South Korea]] is elected to a five-year term, and cannot stand in a [[President]]ial [[Election]] for a second time. The current [[president]] is [[Moon Jae-in]] since 10 May 2017. The previous president, [[Park Geun-hye]], was [[Impeachment|impeached]] for [[corruption]].  == Science and technology == South Korea is a very rich [[country]] and is known for a lot of [[technology]]. This includes the [[car]]-makers [[Hyundai]] and [[Kia Motors|Kia]]. The well-known global brand [[Samsung]], which makes mobile phones, semi-conductors and electric devices, is also South Korean.  == Culture == South Korea has been affected by both continental culture and marine culture because it is located on a peninsula. Ancient South Korean culture has developed with the culture of [[Siberia]], the northern part of [[Central Asia]], the southern part of [[Southeast Asia]] and neighboring countries like [[China]].  === Language === South Korea's customary and official language is [[Korean language|Korean.]] Many linguists says that it is linked with [[Altaic languages]].

It is the only alphabet in the word whose creator, invention day and invention principle is known.  === Food === A customary South Korean regular meal is made up of rice, Korean soup, [[kimchi]] and other various dishes. Generally, Korean dishes are seasoned with [[sesame oil]], [[Doenjang|soy bean paste]], [[soy sauce]], salt, [[ginger]] and [[Gochujang|chilli pepper paste]]. The most famous traditional food of Korea, kimchi, is eaten with nearly every meal. There are lots of popular South Korean typical foods such as [[bibimbap]], [[tteokbokki]], and [[bulgogi]].  === Religion ===  In South Korea, 19.7% of people are [[Protestantism|Protestant]], 6.6% are [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]], 23.2% are [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], 49.3% have no religion, and 1.3% either are a part of other religions or have beliefs that are unknown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/country/ks-korea-south/rel-religion|title=Korean religious statistics|publisher=[http://www.nationmaster.com NationMaster.com]|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref>  === Music === The most representative traditional music of Korea is [[Arirang]] and every region has its own folk song.
