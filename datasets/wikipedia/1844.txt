"Saddam" (pronounced "Sad-DAHM") is his [[given name]] or [[personal name]]; "Hussein" is his father's given personal name; "al-Majid" is his family name, and "al-Tikriti" is a name telling what region he was from. In many Arab countries he is usually called "Saddam Hussein' or "Saddam." However, in Iraq, he was and is usually called by his formal presidential title. Some people have argued that calling him only "Saddam" may be rude and academically out of place. It is common for Arab men to add the name of the town or village they are from to their name. This would make his name "Saddam Hussein al-Awja."</ref> (28 April 1937<ref name="ref2">Under his government, this date was his official date of birth.

He never knew his father, Hussein 'Abd al-Majid, who disappeared five months before Saddam was born. Shortly before Saddam was born, Saddam's twelve-year-old brother died of [[cancer]], leaving his [[mother]] very [[clinical depression|depressed]] in the final months of the [[pregnancy]]. She tried to [[Suicide|kill herself]] near the end of the pregnancy and did not want to care for Saddam when he was born. Saddam was sent to the family of an [[uncle]], Khairallah Tulfah, until he was three.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/15/books/was-a-tyrant-prefigured-by-baby-saddam.html|title=Was a Tyrant Prefigured by Baby Saddam?|last=Bumiller|first=Elisabeth|date=May 15, 2004|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 14, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>  At 10, Saddam ran away from the family to return to live with his uncle, who was a devout [[Sunni]] Muslim, in [[Baghdad]]. According to Saddam, in [[1957]], at the age of 20, Saddam became part of the [[Ba'ath Party]]. The Ba'ath party is an [[Arab people|Arab]] [[political party]] that supports [[socialism]].  In [[1958]], Hussein was [[arrest]]ed for [[Murder|killing]] his [[brother-in-law]] because he was a [[Communism|communist]] [[Activism|activist]]. He spent six months in [[prison]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/07/01/fast-facts-saddam-hussein/|title=Fast Facts: Saddam Hussein|publisher=Fox News.com|access-date=14 August 2013}}</ref>  == Rise in the Ba'ath party == A year after Saddam had joined the Ba'ath party, army officers led by [[Abdul Karim Qassim|General Abdul Karim Qassim]] got rid of [[Faisal II of Iraq]]. The Baathists were against the new [[regime]], and in [[1959]], Saddam was involved in the attempted murder of Prime Minister Qassim. Saddam was [[Gunshot wound|shot]] in the leg, but managed to get away to [[Syria]]. Later, he moved to [[Egypt]]. He was [[Death penalty|sentenced to death]]. In [[exile]], he attended the [[University of Cairo]] [[law school]].  Army officers, including some with the Ba'ath party, came to power in Iraq in a military [[coup]] in [[1963]]. However, the new regime was kicked out quickly. Saddam returned to Iraq, but was imprisoned in [[1964]] when an anti-Ba'ath group led by [[Abdul Rahman Arif]] took power. He escaped from jail in [[1967]] and became one of the leading members of the party.  == Gaining power ==  In [[1976]], Saddam was made a [[General officer|general]] in the Iraqi army. He quickly became the most important person of the [[regime]]. He slowly began to gain more power over Iraq's government and the Ba'ath party. As Iraq's weak, old President, [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]], became more unable to do the duties of his office, Saddam began to take on an more important role as the head of the Iraqi government. He soon became the creator of Iraq's [[foreign policy]] and represented the nation in all [[Diplomatic relations|diplomatic]] situations.  === Conflict with Iran === In [[1979]], Iran's [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] was overthrown by the [[History of Iran#Islamic Revolution|Islamic Revolution]], giving way to an [[Islamic republic]] led by the [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]]. The influence of revolutionary [[Shi'ite]] Islam grew in the region, particularly in countries with large Shi'ite [[population]]s, especially Iraq. Saddam was afraid that radical Islamic ideas were quickly spreading inside his country among most of the Shi'ite people.  He worried that these ideas would go against his leadership.  There had also been a rivalry between Saddam and Khomeini since the [[1970s]]. Khomeini was [[exile]]d from Iran in [[1964]].  He began living in Iraq, at the Shi'ite holy city of [[An Najaf]]. There, he became involved with Iraqi Shi'ites and gained many religious and [[Politics|political]] followers throughout the world.  Under pressure from the Shah, who had agreed to a [[rapprochement]] between Iraq and Iran in [[1975]], Saddam agreed to kick Khomeini out in [[1978]]. After the Islamic Revolution, Khomeini thought defeating Saddam's government may have been the second most important thing to do, only behind keeping his power in Iran.  == The Iran-Iraq War == After Khomeini gained power, small [[battle]]s between Iraq and revolutionary Iran happened for ten months. The two countries were fighting over who controlled the [[Shatt al-Arab waterway]], which divides Iran and Iraq.  Iraq and Iran officially went to war with each other on [[September 22]], [[1980]].  Saddam used the disagreement over the waterway as an excuse to go to war with Iran.  However, the war was more likely an attempt by Saddam - supported by both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] - to have Iraq stop radical revolutions like the one in Iran from spreading any further.  In the first days of the war, there was heavy ground fighting around major [[port]]s as Iraq launched an attack on Iran's [[oil]]-rich, Arab-populated [[province]] of [[Khuzestan]]. After making some gains, Iraq's [[Soldier|troops]] began to suffer losses from human-wave attacks by Iran. By [[1982]], Iraq was looking to end the war.  === Chemical warfare === During the war, Iraq used [[chemical warfare]] against Iranian forces and [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Separatism|separatists]]. On [[March 16]], [[1988]], Saddam ordered Iraqi troops to stop a Kurdish uprising. Iraq attacked the Kurdish town of [[Halabjah]] with a mix of [[poison gas]] and [[nerve agent]]s, killing 5000 people, mostly women and children.  Saddam reached out to other Arab governments for cash and political help. The Iranians, hoping to bring down Saddam's non-religious government and start a Shi'ite [[rebellion]] in Iraq, refused a cease-fire until [[1988]].  === End of the war === The eight-year war ended in a tie. There were hundreds of thousands of [[Casualty (person)|casualties]]. Perhaps 1.7 million died on both sides. Both [[Economy|economies]], previously healthy and growing, were left in ruins.  Saddam was also stuck with a [[debt]] of roughly $75 billion. Borrowing money from the U.S. was making Iraq into its client state, embarrassing a strongman who had sought to define and dominate Arab [[nationalism]]. Saddam also borrowed a large amount of money from other Arab states during the [[1980s]] to fight Iran. Faced with rebuilding Iraq's [[infrastructure]], Saddam desperately sought out cash once again, this time for postwar reconstruction.  <div align=center><gallery perrow="6">  File:Operation Ramadan ul-Mubarak map.svg|The war was over the Shatt al-Arab waterway (the dotted blue and black line)  File:Children In iraq-iran war3.jpg|[[Child soldier]] in the Iran-Iraq War  File:Sardashtchemic.jpg|Victims of Iraq's attacks with poison gas  File:Halabja cemetery.jpg|[[Graves]] for Kurds killed in the [[Halabja chemical attack]]  File:Murdered Iraqi POW 2.jpg|A murdered Iraqi [[prisoner of war|POW]]  </gallery></div>  == After the war: Tensions with Kuwait == Saddam was pressuring [[Kuwait]] to forgive its share of his debt, some $30 billion. (This would mean Iraq would not have to pay back Kuwait's $30 million.) Saddam argued that the struggle with Iran had been fought for the benefit of the other Persian Gulf Arab states as much as for Iraq.  Because of this, he said, a share of Iraqi debt should be forgiven.  Saddam had pushed oil-[[export]]ing countries to raise oil prices and cut back production.  Not only did Kuwait refuse to do this; they also helped support [[OPEC]]'s opposition to the production cuts that Saddam had requested. Kuwait was pumping large amounts of oil, and keeping prices low, when Iraq needed to sell high-priced oil from its [[Oil well|wells]] to pay off a huge debt.  The fact that Kuwait had so much oil made the region even more tense. Even though Kuwait had fewer people, it had about as much oil in reserve as Iraq. Together, Iraq and Kuwait had 20 percent of the world's known oil reserves.  The Kuwaiti [[monarchy]] made Saddam even angrier by drilling oil out of Iraqi wells. At the time, Saddam's regime was not disliked by most of the world. Saddam complained about the drilling to the [[United States State Department]]. Although this had gone on for years, Saddam now needed oil money to get rid of a looming economic crisis. Saddam still had an experienced and well-equipped army, which he used to influence regional affairs. He later ordered troops to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti [[border]].  As Iraqi-Kuwaiti relations rapidly grew worse, Saddam was getting different information about how the United States would respond to an [[invasion]]. The United States had been working on starting a good relationship with Iraq for roughly a [[decade]]. The [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] gave Saddam roughly $40 billion worth of [[Weapon|arms]] in the [[1980s]] to fight Iran, nearly all of it on [[credit]]. The U.S. also sent billions of dollars of food and arms to Saddam to keep him from forming a strong [[alliance]] with the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]].<ref>A free access online archive relating to U.S.-Iraq relations in the [[1980s]] is offered by ''The National Security Archive'' of the [[George Washington University]]. It can be read online at [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB82/]. The Mount Holyoke International Relations Program also provides a free access document briefing on U.S.-Iraq relations ([[1904]]- present); this can be accessed online at [http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/iraq.htm].</ref>  The U.S. [[ambassador]] to Iraq, [[April Glaspie]], met with Saddam in a meeting on [[July 25]]. Saddam said he wanted to keep talks going. U.S. officials tried to take a calm, relaxing tone with Iraq.  They explained that neither [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]] or [[Secretary of State]] [[James Baker]] wanted military force to be used.  However, they also said that they would not take any position on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti dispute and did not want to become involved.  Later, Iraq and Kuwait met for a final [[negotiation]] session, which failed. Saddam then sent his troops into Kuwait.  == The Gulf War == {{mainarticle|Gulf War}} In [[August 2]], [[1990]], Saddam invaded Kuwait, causing an international crisis. The invasion of Kuwait gave Iraq, with its own substantial oil fields, control of 20 percent of the [[Persian Gulf]] oil. The U.S. helped Saddam Hussein in the war with Iran, but with Iraq's take over of the oil-rich [[emirate]] of [[Kuwait]] in August of [[1990]], the United States led a [[United Nations]] force that drove Saddam from Kuwait in [[February]] [[1991]].  Because the United States and the Soviet Union were [[Cooperation|cooperating]] in the [[United Nations Security Council]], the Security Council was able to pass resolutions.  These resolutions gave Iraq a [[deadline]] to leave Kuwait.  Saddam ignored the Security Council deadline. On [[January 16]], [[1991]], coalition of U.S. and Security Council troops launched [[missile]] attacks on Iraq. The [[United States]] and a group of [[Ally|allies]] it had quickly gathered, including [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], and [[Saudi Arabia]], made Saddam's army move from Kuwait in January [[1991]].  [[Israel]], though Saddam attacked it with Iraqi missiles, did not fight back.  It did not want to anger Arab states into leaving the coalition. But Saddam had focused attention on the [[Palestinian]] problem by promising to make his forces leave from Kuwait if [[Israel]] would leave the [[West Bank]], the [[Golan Heights]], and the [[Gaza Strip]]. Saddam's proposal further split the Arab world, pitting U.S.- and Western-supported Arab states against the Palestinians.  175,000 Iraqis were taken prisoner and about 85,000 died. As part of the [[Ceasefire|cease-fire]] agreement, Iraq agreed to get rid of all poison gas and [[Biological weapon|germ weapons]], and to allow UN observers to inspect the sites.  === After the war === All of the different [[religion]]s and the [[violence]] the war had created caused after-war [[rebel]]lions. After the war, fighting between Shi'ite Muslims, Kurds, and [[dissident]] military units was bad. This was a problem to Saddam's rule. Saddam acted by stopping all rebellions in their tracks, especially in the North.  Before the war ended, the United States had encouraged Iraqis to rise up against Saddam. However, when the Shi'ites, Kurds, and dissidents did rise up against Saddam, the United States did not support them.  Without United States support for these rebellions, Saddam survived them. He was then left completely in control of Iraq. The country's [[economy]] and [[army]] never recovered from the Gulf War. However, Saddam often claimed that Iraq had won the Gulf War, and the United States had lost. This made Saddam popular in many parts of the Arab world.  Saddam liked to show himself as a strict [[Muslim]]. This was to calm down the religious parts of the society. He brought back some parts of [[Sharia law]]. This included the [[2001]] law that said [[homosexuality]] could be punished by the [[death penalty]]. The phrase "[[Allahu Akbar]]" ("''[[God]] is great''"), in Saddam's handwriting, was added to the Iraq national [[flag]].  == 1991-2003 == Relations between the United States and Iraq remained tense after the Gulf War. In [[1993]], the United States decided to attack Iraq, because it thought [[evidence]] showed Iraq had sponsored a plan to kill former President George H.W. Bush. On [[June 26]], 1993, the United States launched a missile attack aimed at Iraq's [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] [[headquarters]] in Baghdad.  The United Nations placed a trade [[embargo]] on Iraq, blocking Iraqi oil [[export]]s. This caused hardship in Iraq and almost destroyed the Iraqi economy and state [[infrastructure]]. Only smuggling across the [[Syria]]n border, and [[humanitarian aid]] kept Iraq from crisis. Later, limited amounts of income from the United Nations [[oil-for-food]] program started flowing into Iraq. On [[December 9]], [[1996]], the United Nations allowed Baghdad to begin selling limited amounts of oil for food and [[medicine]].  U.S. officials continued to accuse Saddam of violating the Gulf War's cease-fire agreement, by developing [[weapons of mass destruction]] and other banned weapons, and by violating the UN-imposed sanctions and "no-fly zones." Isolated military strikes by U.S. and British forces continued on Iraq, the largest being [[Operation Desert Fox]] in [[1998]]. After two years of intermittent activity, U.S. and British warplanes struck harder at sites near Baghdad in [[February]] [[2001]].  Saddam's base of Tikriti tribesmen, family members, and other supporters was divided after the war and in the following years.  This added to the regime's increasingly [[repressive]] and [[wikt:arbitrary|arbitrary]] nature. Domestic repression inside Iraq grew worse, and Saddam's sons, [[Uday Hussein]] and [[Qusay Hussein]], became increasingly powerful and carried out a private reign of [[Terrorism|terror]]. They likely had a leading hand when, in [[August]] [[1995]], two of Saddam Hussein's sons-in-law, who held high positions in the Iraqi military, defected to [[Jordan]]. Both were killed after returning to Iraq the following February.  == 2003 invasion of Iraq == {{seealso|2003 invasion of Iraq}} In [[2003]], the United States [[2003 invasion of Iraq|led an invasion of Iraq]].  The main reason for the invasion was President [[George W. Bush|George W. Bush's]] claim that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.  Bush argued that this made Saddam a major threat to Western allies, such as oil-rich Saudi Arabia and Israel; to Western oil supplies from the Persian Gulf states; and to Middle East stability in general.  The President before Bush, [[Bill Clinton]] ([[1993]]-[[2001]]), maintained [[sanctions]] and made occasional air strikes in the "[[Iraqi no-fly zones]]" or other restrictions, in the hope that Saddam would be overthrown by his many political enemies.  However, this never happened.  Things changed in the United States after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].  In his [[January]] [[2002]] [[State of the Union Address]] to the [[United States Congress]], President Bush said that Iraq, Iran, and [[North Korea]] were an "[[Axis of Evil|axis of evil]]."<ref>For further details see Globe and Mail Update, "Hussein does Baghdad walkabout" [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20030404.wmain0404_5/BNPrint/International] Apr. 4, 2003.</ref>  Bush also argued that Iraq had supported [[Al-Qaeda]], the terrorists who attacked the United States on September 11.  As the war was looming on [[February 24]], [[2003]], Saddam Hussein talked with [[CBS News]] anchor [[Dan Rather]] for more than three hourshis first interview with a U.S. reporter in over ten years.<ref>Dan Rather's interview with Saddam Hussein leading up to the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq on March 20 can be read online (CBSNEWS.com) at [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/02/24/eveningnews/main541817.shtml].</ref>  CBS aired the taped interview later that week.  The Iraqi government and military collapsed within three weeks after the beginning of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S.-led invasion]] on [[March 20]]. The United States tried at least twice to kill Saddam with targeted air strikes, but both failed to hit their target. By the beginning of April, Coalition forces controlled much of Iraq. The resistance of the much-weakened Iraqi Army either crumbled or shifted to [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] tactics, and it appeared that Saddam had lost control of Iraq. He was last seen in a [[video]] which showed him in the Baghdad [[suburb]]s surrounded by supporters. When Baghdad fell to the Coalition on [[April 9]], Saddam was nowhere to be found.  == Pursuit and capture == [[File:SaddamSpiderHole.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[United States Military|American soldiers]] capture Saddam]]  Even when Baghdad was taken over, and most of the fighting had stopped, people still did not know where Saddam was. For a few weeks, some people said they saw Saddam, and some videotapes of Saddam talking came out, but still nobody knows if they were true or not.  Although Saddam was placed at the top of the "[[U.S. list of most-wanted Iraqis|most-wanted list]]," he could not be found, even when the other leaders of the Iraqi regime were arrested. His sons and political [[Heir apparent|heirs]], [[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusai Hussein|Qusay]], were killed in July 2003 in a clash with U.S. forces after a tip from an Iraqi.  On 14 December 2003, the [[Islamic Republic News Agency]] (IRNA) of Iran first reported that Saddam Hussein had been arrested. These reports were soon confirmed by other members of the [[Iraq Interim Governing Council|Governing Council]], by U.S. military sources, and by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]].  [[File:Saddamcapture.jpg|thumb|left|Saddam after being captured]]  Shortly afterwards, the U.S. Civil Administrator in Iraq, [[Paul Bremer]], held a press conference in [[Baghdad]].  He officially announced Saddam's capture by saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, we got him!"  United States soldiers found Saddam around 8:30 PM Iraqi time on 13 December, in what was called [[Operation Red Dawn]].  Saddam was hiding in an underground "[[spider hole]]" at a farmhouse in [[ad-Dawr]], near his hometown of [[Tikrit]].  The first photos taken of Saddam after the soldiers found him did not look like the photos taken when he was President of Iraq. He had grown long hair and a long beard. Later on, he shaved his beard to confirm his identity. [[DNA]] tests proved that he really was Saddam Hussein. People who talked with him after the soldiers found him said he was healthy, and wanted to talk to people and do what they told him to do. Paul Bremer said that Saddam would have a [[trial]], but that he did not know yet what kind of trial.  The [[Iraqi Special Tribunal]] was in charge of Saddam Hussein's trial, and the trials of some people that helped him to be President of Iraq.  In November 2006, Saddam Hussein was found [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] of 148 [[murder]]s. On December 30, 2006, he was [[Executed|put to death]]. The hanging was recorded by officials of the government. A [[witness]] also secretly recorded the hanging with a [[cell phone]] camera, which included sound.  The recording showed Saddam being calm as he was prepared for his final moments. Witnesses and [[executioner]]s could be heard teasing Saddam as the rope was placed on his head, and he was put on the trap door. He was in the middle of a [[prayer]] when the trap door beneath him opened, and he was killed. Later, pictures and live [[video]] of Saddam's taunting and execution, and of his dead [[corpse]] were shown on many Internet sites.  Saddam was buried in his hometown, Al-Awja, Iraq, the next day.  == Personal == Saddam had been [[Marriage|married]] three times. His first marriage was to his first [[cousin]], [[Sajida Talfah]]. She was the oldest daughter of Saddam's uncle, Khairallah Talfah.  Together, Saddam and Sajida had two sons, [[Uday Saddam Hussein]] and [[Qusay Hussein]], and three daughters, Rana, Raghad and Hala.  In early 1997, Sajida was put under [[house arrest]], along with her daughters Raghad and Rana, because they were suspected of being involved in an attempted [[assassination]] on Uday on 12 December 1996. General [[Adnan Khairallah Tuffah]], who was Sajida's brother and Saddam Hussein's boyhood friend, was allegedly [[Execution|executed]] because of his growing popularity.  Saddam Hussein also married two other women.  The second was Samira Shahbandar, whom he married in 1986 after forcing her husband to [[divorce]] her.  She was said to have been his favorite wife.  His third wife was Nidal al-Hamdani, the general manager of the Solar Energy Research Center in the Council of Scientific Research, whose husband apparently was also persuaded to divorce his wife.  In August 1995, Rana; her husband, [[Hussein Kamel]] al Majid; Raghad; her husband, [[Saddam Kamel Majid]]; and their children defected to [[Jordan]]. They returned to Iraq when they were promised that Saddam Hussein would [[pardon]] them. Within three days of their return in February 1996, both of the Majid brothers were executed.  Saddam's daughter Hala is married to [[Jamal Mustafa]], the deputy head of Iraq's Tribal Affairs Office. Neither has been known to be involved in [[politics]]. Another cousin was [[Ali Hassan al-Majid]], also known in the United States as "Chemical Ali," who was accused of ordering the use of poison gas in 1988.<ref>For coverage of the postwar [[CNN]] and [[Al-Arabiya]] interviews with Saddam's daughters, see [https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-08-01-saddams-daughters_x.htm].</ref>  == Execution == Saddam was scheduled to die on Thursday night, 28 December 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003503159_saddam31.html|title=Seattle Times}}</ref> Because of last-minute legal [[Appellate court|appeals]] in Iraq's Supreme Court of Appeals,<ref>Mariam Karouny and Ibon Villelabeitia (26 December 2006).

Saddam Hussein was [[execution|hanged]] on 30 December 2006 at 6:05 AM, Iraqi time. Saddam refused to wear a hood. He was pronounced dead at 6:10 AM Baghdad time. Baghdad had [[curfew]]s on those days, which required people to be off the streets by evening.  == Notes == {{reflist|2}} <small> <sup>2</sup> See PBS Frontline (2003), "The survival of Saddam: secrets of his life and leadership: interview with Sad K.
