Schleyer was a Catholic priest from [[Germany]]. He felt that [[God]] had told him in a dream to make an international language. Volapk conventions took place in [[1884]], [[1887]], and [[1889]]. The aim was to help people from different cultures speak to each other.  Volapk became less popular after 1887 when [[Esperanto]] was published. Part of the reason was that Esperanto is easier to learn with a simpler [[grammar]]. There are believed to only be 20-30 Volapk speakers in the world today.  The vocabulary of Volapk is mostly [[English language|English]], with some words from [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]].   "Vol" and "pk" come from the English words "world" and "speech". The grammar is based on [[Indo-European languages]].  An example of Volapk is the translation of the ''[[Lord's Prayer|Lord's prayer]]'':  [[File:Flag of Volapk.svg|thumb|left|Flag]] <poem>     {{lang|vo|O Fat obas, kel binol in sls, paisaludomz nem ola!
