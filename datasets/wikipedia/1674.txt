This includes [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[protist]]s, [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]].  DNA is in each [[cell]] in the organism and tells cells what [[protein]]s to make. Mostly, these proteins are [[enzymes]]. DNA is [[Heredity|inherited]] by children from their parents. This is why children share [[Phenotype|traits]] with their parents, such as skin, hair and eye color. The DNA in a person is a combination of the DNA from each of their parents.  Part of an organism's DNA is "[[non-coding DNA]]" sequences. They do not code for protein sequences. Some noncoding DNA is transcribed into [[non-coding RNA]] molecules, such as [[transfer RNA]], [[ribosomal RNA]], and [[regulatory RNA]]s. Other sequences are not transcribed at all, or give rise to RNA of unknown function. The amount of non-coding DNA varies greatly among species. For example, over 98% of the human genome is non-coding DNA,<ref>Elgar G. & Vavouri T. 2008. Tuning in to the signals: non-coding sequence conservation in vertebrate genomes. ''Trends Genet''. '''24''' (7): 34452.

[[Virus]]es use either DNA or [[RNA]] to [[infection|infect]] organisms.<ref name="pmid20690825">{{cite journal |author=Van Etten JL, Lane LC, Dunigan DD |title=DNA viruses: the really big ones (giruses) |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |volume=64 |pages=8399 |year=2010 |pmid=20690825 |pmc=2936810 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.112408.134338}}</ref> The [[genome]] [[DNA replication|replication]] of most DNA viruses takes place in the cell's [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], whereas RNA viruses usually replicate in the [[cytoplasm]].  == Structure of DNA == DNA has a double [[helix]] shape, which is like a ladder twisted into a [[spiral]]. Each step of the ladder is a pair of [[nucleotide]]s.  === Nucleotides === A nucleotide is a [[molecule]] made up of: *deoxyribose, a kind of [[sugar]] with 5 [[carbon]] atoms, *a phosphate group made of [[phosphorus]] and [[oxygen]], and *[[nitrogen]]ous [[Base (chemistry)|base]]  DNA is made of four types of nucleotide: * [[Adenine]] (A) * [[Thymine]] (T) * [[Cytosine]] (C) * [[Guanine]] (G)  The 'rungs' of the DNA ladder are each made of two bases, one base coming from each leg. The bases connect in the middle: 'A' ''only'' pairs with 'T', and 'C' ''only'' pairs with 'G'. The bases are held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s.  Adenine (A) and thymine (T) can pair up because they make two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine (C) and guanine (G) pair up to make three hydrogen bonds. Although the bases are always in fixed pairs, the pairs can come in any order (A-T or T-A; similarly, C-G or G-C). This way, DNA can write 'codes' out of the 'letters' that are the bases. These codes contain the message that tells the cell what to do.  === Chromatin === On chromosomes, the DNA is bound up with [[protein]]s called [[histone]]s to form [[chromatin]]. This association takes part in [[epigenetics]] and [[gene regulation]]. Genes are switched on and off during development and cell activity, and this regulation is the basis of most of the activity which takes place in cells.  == Copying DNA == When DNA is copied, this is called '''[[DNA replication]]'''. Briefly, the hydrogen bonds holding together paired bases are broken and the molecule is split in half: the legs of the ladder are separated. This gives two single strands. New strands are formed by matching the bases (A with T and G with C) to make the missing strands.  First, an [[enzyme]] called DNA helicase splits the DNA down the middle by breaking the hydrogen bonds. Then after the DNA molecule is in two separate pieces, another molecule called [[DNA polymerase]] makes a new strand that matches each of the strands of the split DNA molecule. Each copy of a DNA molecule is made of half of the original (starting) molecule and half of new bases.  === Mutations === When DNA is copied, mistakes are sometimes made  these are called [[mutation]]s. There are four main types of mutations: * ''Deletion'', where one or more bases are left out. * ''Substitution'', where one or more bases are substituted for another base in the sequence. * ''Insertion'', where one or more extra base is put in. ** ''Duplication'', where a sequence of bases pairs are repeated.  Mutations may also be classified by their effect on the structure and function of proteins, or their effect on [[fitness]]. Mutations may be bad for the organism, or neutral, or of benefit. Sometimes mutations are fatal for the organism  the protein made by the new DNA does not work at all, and this causes the [[embryo]] to die. On the other hand, [[evolution]] is moved forward by mutations, when the new version of the protein works better for the organism.  == Protein synthesis == A section of DNA that contains instructions to make a protein is called a [[gene]]. Each gene has the sequence for at least one [[polypeptide]].<ref>Many complex proteins consist of more than one polypeptide, and the polypeptides are coded separately. They are brought together at a later stage: see [[RNA splicing]].</ref> Proteins form structures, and also form enzymes. The enzymes do most of the work in cells. Proteins are made out of smaller [[polypeptide]]s, which are formed of [[amino acid]]s. To make a protein to do a particular job, the correct amino acids have to be joined up in the correct order.  Proteins are made by tiny machines in the cell called [[ribosome]]s.  Ribosomes are in the main body of the cell, but DNA is only in the nucleus of the cell. The codon is part of the DNA, but DNA never leaves the nucleus. Because DNA cannot leave the nucleus, the cell nucleus makes a copy of the DNA sequence in [[RNA]]. This is smaller and can get through the holes  [[pores]]  in the membrane of the nucleus and out into the cell.  Genes encoded in DNA are [[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] into [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) by proteins such as [[RNA polymerase]]. Mature mRNA is then used as a [[template]] for protein synthesis by the ribosome. Ribosomes read [[codon]]s, 'words' made of three base pairs that tell the ribosome which [[amino acid]] to add. The ribosome scans along an mRNA, reading the code while it makes protein. Another RNA called [[tRNA]] helps match the right amino acid to each codon.  == History of DNA research == [[File:Maclyn McCarty with Francis Crick and James D Watson - 10.1371 journal.pbio.0030341.g001-O.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[James D.
