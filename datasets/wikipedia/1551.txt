In this way, France appears as 'presidentialist system' endowed with a 'semi-presidential regime' (1983: 587).

[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#europe Geographical region and composition]</ref> on the eastern shore of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Lithuania is a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], and several other organizations.  About 3,000,000 people live in the country. The official language is [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] which is spoken by more than 82% of the people. [[Vilnius]] is the [[capital (city)|capital]] and largest city.  The colors of the [[Flag of Lithuania|Lithuanian flag]] are yellow (at the top), for the sun, green (in the middle), for the fields, and red (at the bottom), for the blood of Lithuanians fighting for its independence.  == History ==  Lithuania began to turn into a country in the [[7th century|7th]][[9th century|9th]] [[centuries]] from [[Baltic countries|Baltic nations group]]. The Balts, the [[ancestor]]s of Lithuanians and [[Latvia]]ns, came to area between [[Nemunas]], [[Daugava]] [[rivers]] and the [[Baltic Sea]], from a supposed original homeland of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]s. Many [[scientist]]s think they came there sometime in the [[3rd millennium BC]].  The traditional date of the beginning of the country is 1236 when the  Lithuanians won the [[Battle of iauliai]] (Battle of Sun).  Lithuania (at that time - The [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]) made a Treaty with [[Poland]] in 1569. The country was taken over by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1795, ending the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. It got back its [[independence]] on February 16, 1918. It was taken over by the [[Soviet Union]] on June 16, 1940, by [[Nazi Germany]] from 1941-1944 and again the [[Soviet Union]] from 1944-1990. Lithuania re-declared its independence on March 11, 1990. Currently Lithuania is an [[independent]], semi-[[president]]ial, [[democratic]] [[republic]].  == Politics == [[File:Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus and Vice President Dick Cheney in Vilnius, Lithuania.jpg|thumb|left|Valdas Adamkus, a former President and US vice-president Dick Cheney in Vilnius]]  Lithuania has been a member of NATO and the European Union since 2004.  Lithuania is a semi presidential republic, that restored its independence and democracy in 1990. Since then, very important reforms were made and Lithuania is now declared as a democratic state that grants the human rights.  The Constitution that was adopted in 1992 declares that the leader of the country is the President, who must be elected to take office. The elections are held every 5 years. If the President breaks their oath, they can be forced to resign by the Parliament. The President also represents Lithuania abroad and is the commander-in-chief.  The legislative power of Lithuania is called the Seimas, or Parliament. There are 141 members of Seimas who are elected for 4-year-terms. Seimas passes the laws that must be executed by the government, that is formed in Seimas and it must be accepted by the President. The Prime Minister is set and fired by the President.  The justice is under the power of the courts. The supreme court in Lithuania is the Constitutional Court.  == Administrative subdivisions ==  [[File:Municipalities in Lithuania.png|thumb|right|The counties and municipalities in Lithuania]]  Lithuania is divided into [[Counties of Lithuania|10 counties]], 60 municipalities and 500 elderates. The counties are:  * [[Alytus County]] * [[Kaunas County]] * [[Klaipda County]] * [[Marijampol County]] * [[Panevys County]] * [[iauliai County]] * [[Taurag County]] * [[Teliai County]] * [[Utena County]] * [[Vilnius County]]  The county [[governor]] rules the county. He or she must be appointed by the central government. Municipalities are governed by the Municipal Councils that are elected for 4 year terms. The head of a municipality is the [[mayor]]. The elderates are governed by the elders. The elders are appointed by the municipal councils.  == Geography ==  [[File:LithuaniaPhysicalMap-Detailed.png|thumb|right|Physical map of Lithuania]]  Lithuania is a country in northern Europe. Its neighbours are Poland in the southwest, Russia (Kaliningrad) in west, Latvia in north and Belarus in the east. Lithuania borders the [[Baltic Sea]] and 99 kilometres of its [[coast]] belong to Lithuania.
