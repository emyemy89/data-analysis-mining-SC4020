It was designed for [[Linux]], but many other [[operating system]]s can use it too. GNOME aims to provide an easy way to use a computer. GNOME is a [[free software]] project.  It was made because people were questioning whether [[KDE]] is free.  GNOME is part of the GNU project.  == Aims ==  According to the GNOME website:  {{quote|The GNOME project provides two things: The GNOME desktop environment, an intuitive and attractive desktop for users, and the GNOME development platform, an extensive framework for building applications that integrate into the rest of the desktop.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.gnome.org/about/ | title = About GNOME | accessdate = 2005-09-08 }}</ref>}}  The GNOME project puts heavy emphasis on simplicity, usability, and making things just work (see ''[[KISS principle]]''). The other aims of the project are:  * Freedomto create a desktop environment with readily-available source code for re-use under a [[free software license]]. * [[Computer accessibility|Accessibility]]to ensure the desktop can be used by anyone, regardless of technical skill or physical circumstances. * [[Internationalization and localization]]to make the desktop available in many languages. At the moment, GNOME is being translated to 161 languages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://l10n.gnome.org/languages/ |title=GNOME Languages |accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref> * Developer-friendlinessto ensure ease of writing software that integrates smoothly with the desktop, and allow developers a free choice of programming language. * Organizationto adhere to a regular release cycle and maintain a disciplined community structure. * Supportto ensure backing from other institutions beyond the GNOME community.  == Applications == GNOME has many applications written for it. Some of them include:  * [[Abiword]] - A word processor, used for writing [[wikt:document|document]]s * [[Calculator]] - For doing maths * [[Epiphany (software)]] - [[Internet]] [[browser]] * [[Empathy]] - [[Internet]] [[Instant messaging|messenger]] * [[Ekiga]] - [[VoIP]] and [[video conferencing]] * [[Eye of GNOME]] - View your [[picture]] files * [[Gthumb]] - View your [[photo]]s * [[GIMP]] - [[Art]] and [[photo]] [[software]] * [[Nautilus (file manager)|Nautilus]] - [[File manager]] * [[Totem]] - Play [[music]] and [[video]]  ==Related pages== * [[Ubuntu]] Linux  ==References== {{reflist}}  == Other websites == *[http://www.gnome.org The GNOME website] *[http://www.gnomedesktop.org News about GNOME]  {{Tech-stub}} [[Category:GNOME| ]] [[Category:Linux]] [[Category:Desktop Environments]]</text>
