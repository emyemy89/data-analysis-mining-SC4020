<title>Word</title><text>{{for|the popular word processor made by Microsoft|Microsoft Word}}  A '''word''' is something spoken by the [[mouth]], that can be pronounced.  In [[alphabet]]ic writing, it is a collection of [[letter]]s used together to communicate a meaning. These can also usually be pronounced. A [[logogram]] is also a word.  Some words have more than one [[meaning]], for example 'spring' can refer to the season, the [[Spring (device)|device]], or a [[conjugation]] of the verb. These are [[homonym]]s. Some words have different [[pronunciation]], for example, 'wind' (the noun) and 'wind' (the verb) are pronounced differently.   Some words have different [[spelling]] for example 'color' and 'colour', which are both correct. Color is used in [[American English]] and colour is used in [[British English]]. Some words can be only one letter, for example "a" and "I" in [[English language|English]]. Besides English, other [[language]]s have their own words. When written with an alphabet, words are usually separated by a space. When written with [[ideogram]]<nowiki/>s, each word is usually a separate symbol.  Words can be invented. This is called [[neologism]]. For example, [[radar]] was originally an [[acronym]] but became an actual word. Two words may be joined to make a [[compound word]].  == Fuller definition == A word is the smallest thing which can be said ''with meaning''. For example, ''[[hello]]'' is a word. This contrasts with a [[morpheme]], which is the smallest unit of meaning but may not stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: ''oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect''), or several (''rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected''), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just given, these are ''-s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed'').  The meaning of a word can be found in a [[dictionary]].  == Related pages == * [[Lexeme]]   {{stub}}  [[Category:Words| ]] [[Category:Basic English 850 words]]</text>
