<title>Island</title><text>[[File:Island_Pokonji_Dol.jpg|thumb|right|A small island]] An '''island''' is a piece of ground that is surrounded by a body of water such as a lake, river or sea.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2012-08-27|title=island|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/island/|access-date=2020-12-07|website=National Geographic Society|language=en}}</ref> Water is all around an island. Islands are smaller than [[continent]]s. The largest island in the world is [[Greenland]], unless [[Australia]] is believed to be an island.  Most people think Australia is a continent because it is more than three times bigger than Greenland.   Some islands are their own countries. Examples of islands that are their own countries include [[Cuba]], [[Iceland]], and [[Cyprus]]. There are many others. Other islands have more than one country, such as [[Borneo]] and [[Hispaniola]].  == Big islands == === In Europe === * [[Great Britain]] 218,995&nbsp;km * [[Iceland]] 101,826&nbsp;km * [[Ireland]] 81,638&nbsp;km * The island in the north of [[Novaja Zemlja]] 47,079&nbsp;km * [[Spitsbergen]] 38,981&nbsp;km * The island in the south of [[Novaja Zemlja]] 33,246&nbsp;km * [[Sicily]] 25,662&nbsp;km * [[Sardinia]] 23,812&nbsp;km * [[Nordaustlandet]] (archipelago of [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]]) 14,247&nbsp;km * [[Cyprus]] 9,234&nbsp; * [[Corsica]] 8,741&nbsp;km  === Other places === * [[Greenland]] 2,130,800&nbsp;km * [[New Guinea]] 785,753&nbsp;km * [[Borneo]] 748,138&nbsp;km * [[Madagascar]] 587,041&nbsp;km * [[Baffin Island|Baffin]] 507,451&nbsp;km * [[Sumatra]] 677,658&nbsp;km  == Types of island == There are many kinds of island:  * [[Continental shelf|Continental]] islands are made when a part of it breaks off. * [[Barrier island|Barrier islands]] * [[Volcano|Volcanic islands]] * [[Atoll]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  [[Category:Basic English 850 words]] [[Category:Islands| ]]</text>
