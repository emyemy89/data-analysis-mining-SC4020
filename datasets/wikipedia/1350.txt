It uses the [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko layout engine]] from the [[Mozilla]] project to show web pages; however, the Epiphany [[Programmer|developers]] have a new but less stable version of Epiphany 2.21.4 using the [[WebKit]] engine instead of Gecko.<ref>[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NjE3Mg [Phoronix&#93; Exciting Features For GNOME 2.22, 2.24<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://live.gnome.org/Epiphany/Downloads Epiphany Downloads]</ref> The Epiphany team wants to stop using Gecko and only use the [[WebKit]] engine, by the time they release Epiphany 2.24 or 2.26.<ref>[http://mail.gnome.org/archives/epiphany-list/2008-April/msg00000.html ANNOUNCEMENT: The Future of Epiphany<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Epiphany has [[Tabbed Document Interface|tabbed browsing]], [[HTTP cookie|cookie]] management, [[Pop-up ad|popup]] blocking and an extensions system.  Epiphany can be extended with the [[Epiphany-extensions]] package in [[GNU/Linux]] [[Operating System]]s.  Epiphany was made from [[Galeon]] by [[Marco Pesenti Gritti]] (also the creator of Galeon) with the aim of making a web browser with a very simple user experience. Because of that, Epiphany does not have its own themes, instead, it uses GNOMEs settings that are set in the [[GNOME Control Center]].  ==References== {{reflist}}  == Other websites == {{Commons|Epiphany}} *[http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/ Epiphany Homepage] *[http://galeon.sourceforge.net/links/history.php Galeon History homepage] covering the decision to split development *[http://library.gnome.org/devel/hig-book/stable/ GNOME Human Interface Guidelines] *[http://live.gnome.org/Epiphany/WebKit Epiphany WebKit Project]  [[Category:Mozilla]] [[Category:Web browsers]] [[Category:GNOME]]</text>
