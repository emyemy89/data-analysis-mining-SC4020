This [[decade]] (group of ten years) is sometimes called the "Greed decade" in English speaking countries. Unlike the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]], this is when the word ''[[yuppie]]'' was used to describe "young urban professionals"  young [[adult]]s who lived in [[city|cities]] and started to get good [[job]]s. This was also the rise of a more [[conservatism|conservative]] period in these countries  [[Ronald Reagan]] was [[president]] for most of this time in the [[United States]], [[Margaret Thatcher]] was the [[Prime Minister]] of the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Brian Mulroney]] was Prime Minister of [[Canada]].  This decade also saw the [[Soviet Union]] fight a [[war]] that seemed endless in [[Afghanistan]], [[civil war]] in [[Ethiopia]], and the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] which started the end of the [[Cold War]] and of [[Communism]] in [[Eastern Europe]].  The "eighties" are also well known for their extreme [[fashion]]s, such as "[[big hair]]", [[New Wave]], [[punk rock]], [[funk]], or [[preppy|preppies]].  [[Rap]] music first started to get big in the 80s, and often went with [[breakdancing]] in what is now called the "old school" days. Many developments were also made in [[computer]] technology during these years, and [[video game]]s became popular.  In sports, [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] won the [[FIFA World Cup]]. The [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]], [[Baltimore Orioles]], [[Detroit Tigers]], [[Kansas City Royals]], [[New York Mets]], [[Minnesota Twins]] and [[Oakland Athletics]] won the [[World Series]]. The [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Oakland Raiders]], [[San Francisco 49ers]], [[Washington Redskins]], [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]], [[Chicago Bears]] and [[New York Giants]] won the [[Super Bowl]].
