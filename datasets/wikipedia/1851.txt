<title>List of countries by continents</title><text>{{more sources|date=January 2020}} This article consists of a list of [[countries]] by [[continent]], along with their [[Capital city|capitals]].  There are multiple continent classification systems in use. The first continent system is the seven continent system consisting of [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Oceania]]/[[Australasia|Australia]], [[North America]], [[South America]] and [[Antarctica]].  The six continent system is essentially the same as the seven continent system, the only difference being two continents are merged. There are two versions of the six continent system, one merging Europe and Asia to create [[Eurasia]], and the other merging North and South America to create [[The Americas]]  The five continent system is applying Eurasia and The Americas together, all other continents remain the same.  Finally the four continent system is the same as the prior, however Africa joins Eurasia to become [[Afro-Eurasia]], leaving only Oceania and Antarctica as separate continents.  The only variable in these systems is Antarctica. As Antarctica has no permanent population it isn't uncommon for it to be removed from these classification systems.  The most common system used varies from country to country.  There is no universally accepted answer as to how many countries in the world there actually are. The minimum answer is the 193 [[United Nations]] member states. However, there are many more [[constituent]], [[de facto]] and self-proclaimed independent states that are typically added to that list. Additionally certain highly autonomous first level administrative divisions fall under the definition of the word country.  The list below follows the seven continent system and predominantly includes only U.N member states unless otherwise stated.  ==Africa==  Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20% of its land area, accounting for about a fifth of the world's land. With 1.3 billion people as of 2018, it accounts for about 16% of the world's human population. It is surrounded by large areas of water. There are 54 fully recognized and independent countries in Africa, and 14.7% (1.216 billion) of the world's population lives there. It is thought to be the continent where the first humans evolved.  #[[Egypt]] (Misr) - [[Cairo]] #[[Algeria]] - [[Algiers]] #[[Angola]] - [[Luanda]] #[[Benin]] - [[Porto Novo]], [[Cotonou]] #[[Botswana]] - [[Gaborone]] #[[Burkina Faso]] - [[Ouagadougou]] #[[Burundi]] - [[Gitega]] #[[Cameroon]] (also spelled Cameroun) - [[Yaound]] #[[Cape Verde]] - [[Praia, Cape Verde|Praia]] #[[Central African Republic]] - [[Bangui]] #[[Chad]] (Tchad) - [[N'Djamena]] #[[Comoros]] - [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]] #[[Republic of the Congo]] - [[Brazzaville]] #[[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Zaire) - [[Kinshasa]] #[[Cte d'Ivoire]] (Ivory Coast) - [[Yamoussoukro]] #[[Djibouti]] - [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]] #[[Equatorial Guinea]] - [[Malabo]] #[[Eritrea]] - [[Asmara]] #[[Ethiopia]] (Abyssinia) - [[Addis Ababa]] #[[Gabon]] - [[Libreville]] #[[The Gambia]] - [[Banjul]] #[[Ghana]] - [[Accra]] #[[Guinea]] - [[Conakry]] #[[Guinea-Bissau]] - [[Bissau]] #[[Kenya]] - [[Nairobi]] #[[Lesotho]] - [[Maseru]] #[[Liberia]] - [[Monrovia, Liberia|Monrovia]] #[[Libya]] - [[Tripoli]] #[[Madagascar]] - [[Antananarivo]] #[[Malawi]] - [[mingowe |Lilongwe]] #[[Mali]] - [[Bamako]] #[[Mauritania]] - [[Nouakchott]] #[[Mauritius]] - [[Port Louis]] #[[Morocco]] (Al Maghrib) - [[Rabat]] #[[Mozambique]] - [[Maputo]] #[[Namibia]] - [[Windhoek]] #[[Niger]] - [[Niamey]] #[[Nigeria]] - [[Abuja]] #[[Rwanda]] - [[Kigali]] #[[So Tom and Prncipe]] - [[So Tom]] #[[Senegal]] - [[Dakar]] #[[Seychelles]] - [[Victoria, Seychelles]] #[[Sierra Leone]] - [[Freetown]] #[[Somalia]] - [[Mogadishu, Somalia|Mogadishu]] #[[South Africa]] -  [[Pretoria]] #[[South Sudan]] - [[Juba]] #[[Swaziland]] ([[Eswatini]]) - [[Mbabane]] #[[Tanzania]] - [[Dodoma]] #[[Togo]] - [[Lome]] #[[Tunisia]] - [[Tunis]] #[[Uganda]] - [[Kampala]] #[[Western Sahara]] - [[El Aain]] (disputed) #Zambia - Lusaka #[[Sudan]] - [[Khartoum]] #[[Zimbabwe]] - [[Harare]]  == Antarctica == [[Antarctica]] is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic [[South Pole]] and is in the Antarctic region of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], almost entirely south of the [[Antarctic Circle]]. It is surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]. At 14,000,000 square kilometres (5,400,000 square miles), it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of [[Australia]].   About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice. However, there is a large part where the ice does not cover land: the [[ice shelf|ice shelves]]. There are important geographical features covered by the ice. The huge [[Lake Vostok]] has been covered by ice for at least 15 million years. There is a massive [[rift valley]] and a huge [[mountain range]], both of which are covered at present.  == Asia == [[Asia]] is the largest and most populous continent and is a continent in the seven continent system. Asia consists of forty-eight countries as per the United Nations along with many other highly autonomous regions and disputed areas that are often generalised as countries of their own.  #[[Afghanistan]]    - [[Kabul]] #[[Armenia]]        - [[Yerevan]] #[[Azerbaijan]]     - [[Baku]] #[[Bahrain]] - [[Manama]] #[[Bangladesh]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bangladesh.gov.bd/index.php?lang=en|title=Bangladesh National Portal}}</ref>([http://www.bangladesh.gov.bd/index.php?lang=en ]) - [[Dhaka]] ([[Dhaka|]]) #[[Bhutan]] - [[Thimphu]] #[[Brunei]] - [[Bandar Seri Begawan]] #[[Cambodia]] (Kampuchea) - [[Phnom Penh]] #[[China]] - [[Beijing]] #[[East Timor]] (Timor Leste) - [[Dili]] #[[Georgia]] - [[Tbilisi]] #[[India]] - [[New Delhi]] #[[Indonesia]] - [[Jakarta]] #[[Iran]] - [[Tehran]] #[[Iraq]] - [[Baghdad]] #[[Israel]] - [[Jerusalem]] #[[Japan]] - [[Tokyo]] #[[Jordan]] (Al Urdun) - [[Amman]] #[[Kazakhstan]] - [[nursultan]] #[[Kuwait]] - Kuwait city #[[Kyrgyzstan]] - [[Bishkek]] #[[Laos]] - [[Vientiane]] #[[Lebanon]] (Lubnan) - [[Beirut]] #[[Malaysia]] - [[Kuala Lumpur]] #[[Maldives]] - [[Mal]] #[[Mongolia]] - [[Ulaanbaatar]] #[[Myanmar]] (Burma) - [[Naypyidaw]] #[[Nepal]] - [[Kathmandu]] #[[North Korea]] - [[Pyongyang]] #[[Oman]] - [[Muscat]] #[[Pakistan]] - [[Islamabad]] #[[Philippines]] - [[Manila]] #[[Qatar]] - [[Doha]] #[[Russia]] - [[Moscow]] (Russia is a part of Asia geographically, but politically it is a part of Europe) #[[Saudi Arabia]] - [[Riyadh]] #[[Singapore]] - [[Singapore]] #[[South Korea]] - [[Seoul]] #[[Sri Lanka]] - [[Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte]] (administrative), [[Colombo]] (commercial) #[[Syria]] - [[Damascus (Dimashq)|Damascus]] #[[Tajikistan]] - [[Dushanbe]] #[[Thailand]] (Muang Thai) - [[Bangkok]] #[[Turkey]] - [[Ankara]] #[[Turkmenistan]] - [[Agabat]] #[[Taiwan]] - [[Taipei]] #[[United Arab Emirates]] - [[Abu Dhabi]] #[[Uzbekistan]] - [[Tashkent]] #[[Vietnam]] - [[Hanoi]] #[[Yemen]] - [[Sana'a]]  == Europe == [[Europe]] is the second smallest continent, but the third most populous.

Below is the list of fully sovereign or de facto countries that are indisputably either entirely or partially situated within Europe. The 49 countries are:  #[[Albania]] (Shqipria) - [[Tirana]] #[[Andorra]] - [[Andorra la Vella]] #[[Austria]] (sterreich) - [[Vienna]] #[[Belarus]] () - [[Minsk]] #[[Belgium]] (''Dutch'': Belgi, ''French:''Belgique, ''German:''Belgien) - [[Brussels]] #[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (Bosna i Hercegovina) - [[Sarajevo]] #[[Bulgaria]] () - [[Sofia]] #[[Croatia]] (Hrvatska) - [[Zagreb]] #[[Cyprus]] () - [[Nicosia]] #[[Czech Republic]] (esko) - [[Prague]] #[[Denmark]] (Danmark) - [[Copenhagen]] #[[Estonia]] (Eesti) - [[Tallinn]] #[[Finland]] (Suomi) - [[Helsinki]] # #[[Georgia]] - [[Tbilisi]] #[[Germany]] (Deutschland) - [[Berlin]] #[[Greece]] () - [[Athens]] #[[Hungary]] (Magyarorszg) - [[Budapest]] #[[Iceland]]** (Island) - [[Reykjavik]] #[[Republic of Ireland]] (ire) - [[Dublin]] #[[Italy]] (Italia) - [[Rome]] #[[Kazakhstan]] - [[nursultan]] #[[Kosovo]]** - Pristina #[[Latvia]] (Latvija) - [[Riga]] #[[Liechtenstein]] - [[Vaduz]] #[[Lithuania]] (Lietuva) - [[Vilnius]] #[[Luxembourg]] - [[Luxembourg City]] #[[North Macedonia]] () - [[Skopje]] #[[Malta]] - [[Valletta]] #[[Moldova]] - [[Chisinau]] #[[Monaco]] - Monte Carlo Quarter #[[Montenegro]] (Crna Gora,  ) - [[Podgorica]] #[[Netherlands]] (Nederland) - [[Amsterdam]] (Capital), [[The Hague]] (Government) #[[Norway]] (Norge) - [[Oslo]] #[[Poland]] (Polska) - [[Warsaw, Poland|Warsaw]] #[[Portugal]] - [[Lisbon]] #[[Romania]] - [[Bucharest]] #[[Russia]]** [[Moscow]] (Europe up to the [[Ural Mountains]]; Asia: the rest to [[Vladivostok]]) #[[San Marino]] - [[San Marino]] #[[Serbia]] () - [[Belgrade]] #[[Slovakia]] (Slovensko) - [[Bratislava]] #[[Slovenia]] (Slovenija) - [[Ljubljana]] #[[France]] - [[Paris]] #[[Spain]] (Espaa) - [[Madrid]] #[[Sweden]] (Sverige) - [[Stockholm]] #[[Switzerland]] (''German:'' Schweiz, ''French:'' Suisse, ''Italian:'' Svizzera, ''Romansh'': Svizra) - [[Bern (city)|Bern]] #[[Turkey]] - [[Ankara]] #[[Ukraine]] () - [[Kyiv]] or [[Kiev]] #[[United Kingdom]] - [[London]] #[[Vatican City]]** (''Italian:'' Citt del Vaticano, ''Latin:'' Civitas Vaticana) - [[Vatican City]]  There is no official boundary between Europe and Asia, as a result the continental status of some countries is often disputed. However Russia is considered to be European by the United Nations. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey are considered to be a part of Asia by the United Nations.  Kosovo is a highly recognised [[disputed territory]] with de facto independence.  Iceland sits on the European - North American [[tectonic plates]]. The Western half sits in North America, while the Eastern half sits on the European tectonic plate.

It is a continent in the seven continent system. In other systems it is part of The Americas. The 12 countries and 3 dependent territories belonging to it are as follows:  #[[Brazil]] (Brasil) - [[Braslia]] #[[Argentina]] - [[Buenos Aires]] #[[Bolivia]] - [[Sucre|Sucr]] #[[Chile]] - [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] #[[Colombia]] - [[Bogot]] #[[Ecuador]] - [[Quito]] #[[Falkland Islands]] - Stanley (territory of U.K.) #[[French Guiana]] - [[Cayenne]] (territory of France) #[[Guyana]] - [[Georgetown]] #[[Paraguay]] - [[Asuncion|Asuncin]] #[[Peru]] - [[Lima, Peru|Lima]] #[[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] - (territory of U.K.) #[[Suriname]] - [[Paramaribo]] #[[Uruguay]] - [[Montevideo]] #[[Venezuela]] - [[Caracas]]  ==Australasia/Oceania== Several terms are in use to describe the region of Australia and the nations of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The term ''[[Oceania]]'' is usually preferred, and this is the term in use by the [[United Nations]]. The term ''[[Pacific Islands]]'' generally excludes the islands of New Zealand, and the continent of Australia. The indigenous Mori of New Zealand are Polynesian people.  Historically, the region was called ''[[Australasia]]''. This term is based more on [[natural history]] ([[geology]], and [[geography]]) rather than on politics. This term means Australia, New Zealand and the whole of [[New Guinea]], plus those islands which are ''geologically'' connected.   The countries (14 total) are listed below according to their UN classification:  #[[Australia]] - Canberra #[[Fiji]] - [[Suva]] #[[New Zealand]] - [[Wellington]] #[[Federated States of Micronesia]] - [[Palikir]] #[[Kiribati]] - [[South Tarawa]] #[[Marshall Islands]] - [[Majuro]] #[[Nauru]] - no capital; biggest city is [[Yaren]] #[[Palau]] - Ngerulmud #[[Papua New Guinea]] - [[Port Moresby]] #[[Samoa]] - [[Apia]] #[[Solomon Islands]] - [[Honiara]] #[[Tonga]] - [[Nuku'alofa]] #[[Tuvalu]] - [[Funafuti]] #[[Vanuatu]] - [[Port Vila]]  [[Australasia]] is not a politically designated region. It is a natural region of ''islands'' designated by its [[geology]], [[geography]], [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. It is also an [[ecozone]].  #[[Australia]] #[[Flores]] #[[Lombok]] #[[Melanesia]] #[[New Caledonia]] #[[New Guinea]] #[[Sulawesi]] #[[Sumbawa]] #[[Timor]]  ==References== {{reflist}}  == Other websites == * http://www.world-gazetteer.com/home.htm * http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/ * http://ontheworldmap.com  {{DEFAULTSORT:countries by continents, List of}} [[Category:Lists of countries|*Continents]] [[Category:Lists by continent]]</text>
