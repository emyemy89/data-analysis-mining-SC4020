This means that a lot of people may not be able to change pages.  If you are blocked and want to change pages you may send an email to [mailto:simple-admins-l@lists.wikimedia.org|'''simple-admins-l@lists.wikimedia.org'''] and an administrator will look at your reason and reply.  Also, if you have a dynamic IP address, some dynamic IP addresses may already be blocked when they are assigned to you.  We are sorry for any problems this may cause.</text>
