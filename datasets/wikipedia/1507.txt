<title>Video game</title><text>'''Video games''' are [[Electronics|electronic]] [[game]]s played on a video screen (normally a [[television]], a built-in screen when played on a handheld machine, or a computer).   There are many types, or [[genre]]s, of these games: [[role-playing game]]s; [[shooter]]s, [[first-person shooter]]s, [[side-scroller]]s, and [[platformer]]s are just a few.   Video games usually come on [[compact disc|CD]]s, [[DVD]]s or digital [[download]]. Many games used to come on [[Cartridge (electronics)|cartridges]]. A specialised device used to play a video game at home is called a [[Video game console|console]]. There have been many types of consoles and [[home computer]]s used to play video games. Some of the first were the [[Atari 2600]], the [[Sega Master System]] and [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in the 1980s. Newer video game consoles are the [[Xbox One]], [[PlayStation 4]] and Nintendo Switch. The best selling video game console of all time is the PlayStation 2, made by [[Sony]].  People can also use computers to play games, which are sometimes called PC games. The older consoles do not have new games developed for them often, although console games are emulated for PCs (see [[emulator]]). This means that new computers can play many old console games along with games made just for new computers. Older games are often more popular emulated than when they were first on sale, because of the ease of [[download]].  People can play portable video games anywhere. [[Mobile device]]s (running [[operating system]]s such as [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]]) also can download games, making them portable game machines. [[Mobile phone]]s have many games, some of them using a mobile emulator for games from consoles. Not all PC or console Games are on mobile or [[IPad Mini|iPad]]/ [[IPod touch|iPod]]/[[Tablet computer|Tablet]].  Competitions of video game players are called [[electronic sports]]. [[File:Attention span.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A kid plays a video game on a [[GameCube]] console.]]  == Current generation consoles == * The [[Xbox One]] came out in November 2013 followed by the Xbox One S in November 2016, and then by the [[Xbox One X]], originally named Xbox Scorpio, in November 2017. It is the newest version of the [[Xbox]] series, which is made by the [[United States|American]] company [[Microsoft]]. It replaced the [[Xbox 360]] and offers a similar online experience and controller, but with improved graphics. Like the original and 360 versions, it also allows people to put music from an [[MP3|MP3 player]] or other sources onto the system. It was the last of the 8th generation consoles to come out. * The [[PlayStation 4]] (PS4) came out in November 2013. It is the newest of the [[PlayStation]] game consoles from [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], a division of the [[Japan]]ese company [[Sony]]. It also has better graphics and online gameplay. Like its previous model, the [[PlayStation 3|PS3]], the PS4 can play movies, music, and browse the internet. * [[Nintendo]], another Japanese company, has made many video game consoles over the years. One of its most recent was the [[Wii U]] in November 2012. It is the first console from Nintendo with high-definition graphics. Like the original [[Wii]] which came before it, it has a unique controller. Its controller is shaped like a [[tablet computer]] with ordinary controller buttons around the edges of the screen. In 2017, Nintendo released the [[Nintendo Switch]]. This is the second Nintendo console in this generation.   [[File:ArcadeGames.jpg|thumb|220px|Humans play on video game arcade cabinets.]]  ==Current handheld consoles== Sony's [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP) came out in 2004. A new version, the [[PlayStation Vita]], first came out in 2012.  Also in 2004, Nintendo released the [[Nintendo DS|Dual Screen (DS)]], which has two separate screens, one of which is a [[touchscreen]]. New versions came out in later years, such as the [[Nintendo DSi]] in 2008 and the [[Nintendo DSi XL]]. The [[Nintendo 3DS]], the first handheld console with [[3D]] graphics, came out in 2011. The [[Nintendo 2DS|2DS]] followed in 2013. The New 3DS XL, which is similar to the 3DS but with updated graphical capabilities, was released in 2015. The latest entry into the DS lineup is the "New 2DS XL", released on the 28th of July 2017.  In March 2017, Nintendo began selling a new console called the [[Nintendo Switch]], which looks like a tablet computer but can also be plugged into a TV. It is the first example of a "hybrid console" that can be used as both as a TV-based model and a handheld device.  == History of video games == The first video game ever is often said to be ''Tennis for Two''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200810/physicshistory.cfm |title=October 1958: Physicist Invents First Video Game|language=en |access-date=2018-06-29}}</ref>, a rudimentary tennis game to be played with two people developed in 1958. Another early example is ''[[Spacewar!]]'', developed in 1962.  In the 1950s, when the first computers began to be made, three people had some ideas to create the basis of actual video games. In 1951, Ralph Baer, an American engineer of Loral Electronics, tried to create "the best television", proposing to add a gaming module, but his employer did not like his idea. Even if his idea was never realized, he is the first man to have thought of the idea of video games, later creating the first video game console, the Odyssey. Later, in 1952, A.S Douglas, of the [[Cambridge University]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], made a video game on a computer in order to illustrate one of his speeches. The game, called ''[[OXO]]'', was a tic-tac-toe game, with two players (the person itself and the opponent, the computer) .In 1953, Willy Higinbotham made a game called ''Tennis For Two'', similar to the later ''[[Pong]]'', to entertain visitors to [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]. Another early video game is a version of checkers, but this is largely overlooked.   One of the most famous and one of the earliest video games ever is called ''[[Space Invaders]]''. ''Space Invaders'' was made in 1978 as a coin operated [[arcade game]] but a version has been made for almost every game console and home computer ever available.  == Related pages == * [[Video game collecting]] * [[Video game journalism]]  ==References == {{reflist}} * [[Category:Video games| ]]</text>
