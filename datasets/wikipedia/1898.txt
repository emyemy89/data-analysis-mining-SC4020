<title>Flood</title><text>'''''A flood is an overflow of water on normally dry ground. This is most commonly due to an overflowing [[river]], a [[dam]] break, [[snowmelt]], or heavy [[rain|rainfall]]. Less commonly happening are [[tsunami]]s, [[storm surge]].'''''  '''''The most deadly flooding was in 1931 in China and killed between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 people.<ref>O'Connor, Jim E. and John E. Costa. 2004. The world's largest floods, past and present: their causes and magnitudes [Circular 1254].

The process of leaving homes in search of a safe place is called flood [[evacuation]].'''''  == '''''Pollution of drinking water''''' == [[File:Alicante(30-09-1997).JPG|thumb|right|Autumn [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean]] flooding in [[Alicante]], [[Spain]], September of 1997]]  '''''During a flood there is plenty of water logging and overflow of water, but it is mostly [[water pollution|polluted]] and not safe to drink.  If people drink this dirty water, they may suffer from [[diseases]] such as [[typhoid]] and [[cholera|cholera, hepatitis and other such diseases]].  People can get ready to survive a flood by filling many [[Container|containers]] with fresh and clean [[drinking water]] and storing other [[emergency]] supplies; like: medicine and food. During flood people try to go to higher sides because the flood water wouldn't reach high areas. Also drains overflow and mix with clean water and people who drink it might fall ill.'''''  == '''''Causes of floods''''' == '''''Flooding is usually caused when a volume of water within a water body, such as a [[lake]], overflows outside it.Sometimes if a [[dam]] breaks, it suddenly releases a large amount of water. The result is that some of the water travels to land, and 'floods' the area.Many rivers are in a channel, between river banks. They flood when the strength of the river causes it to flow beyond the banks. This is more common at bends or [[meander]]s. Flood damage can be prevented by moving away from places that flood. However, people have long liked to have their homes and businesses alongside water because water is good for [[agriculture]] and [[transport]] and in other ways. Floods are also caused due to improper management of drains. [[Rainfall]] is the most common cause. [[Snow melt]] is also a cause of flooding. [[Tsunami]]s and [[Storm Surge]] are less common ways that floods happen. [[Coastal Flooding]] is another common cause of flooding, and this is caused by [[Storm|low pressure systems or storms]].''  == '''''References''''' == {{Reflist}}  == '''''Related pages''''' == * [[Flood control|'''''Flood control''''']]{{Srfggh}}  {{commonscat|Floods}}  [[Category:Floods| ]]</text>
