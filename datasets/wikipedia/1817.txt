The country is home to more than 200 spoken languages with a large population of overseas-born residents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://businesseventssydney.com.au/sydney-shines/global-city/|title=Sydney Information|website=Business Events Sydney|accessdate=August 30, 2016}}</ref>  In Sydney, there are many famous buildings: the [[Sydney Opera House]], the [[Queen Victoria Building]] and the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]].
