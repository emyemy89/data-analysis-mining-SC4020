<title>Citizenship</title><text>'''Citizenship''' is a [[legal]] [[relationship]] between a person and a [[country]].  Usually the country is the one they were born in, lives in, supports, and in return gets protection.  A person is usually a [[citizen]] of the country where he or she is born, but sometimes a person will apply for [[naturalization]], to become a citizen in another country.  There are countries which allow dual (two) citizenship, and countries which do not.  == Definitions == A citizen is a member of a [[sovereign]] group of people that have certain rights. [[Government]]s protect these rights or take advantage of them. Some Governments may [[exile]] people from citizenship laws on such matter vary between countries. * People born in the country may be citizens by ''Jus soli'', right of soil.  Those having citizen parents may be '''natural born''' citizens.  *Some countries also recognise ''Jus sanguinis'', the right of members of the national [[diaspora]] to be citizens.  Jus sanguinis comes from Latin meaning "right of blood" which basically means one can inherit citizenship by descent from a parent and in some cases a grandparent or even more distant [[ancestor]]<nowiki/>s. * Foreigners can also be ''naturalized'' as citizens.  [[Naturalization]] makes them citizens of their new country.  Many countries require that they give up their citizenship of their old country, but some countries have permanent citizenship; you can't quit such a citizenship. * People who are citizens of more than one country, with approval of both Governments, are '''dual citizens'''. They may legally enter and live in either country. *A person who has no citizenship is called a '''stateless person'''. There are many causes of statelessness: wars, refugees, people whose birth was never registered, people born in a territory which is not recognised as a state, and so on. Some countries are very generous in giving stateless people citizenship, and some are not. The problem is well-known, but there is no general solution. *Citizenship may be permanent. Some countries remove citizenship for various reasons, and some citizens [[renounce]] their citizenship.  == Citizenship in Canada == People born in [[Canada]] become citizens of the country by ''Jus soli'' even if their parents are not citizens.
