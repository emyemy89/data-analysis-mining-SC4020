<title>Family</title><text>{{for|the "family" in [[taxonomy]]|Family (biology)}} [[File:Trneman Familjen.jpg|thumb|]]  A '''family''' is a [[group]] of people who, in most cases, live together. They share their money and food and are supposed to take care of one another. Its members are either [[genetics|genetically]] related (like brother and sister) or legally bound to each other, for example by [[marriage]]. In many cultures, the members of a family have the same or a similar [[surname]].  The family in accordance to the Catholic doctrine is treated in many articles of the Catechism of the Catholic Church starting from the article 2201. <ref>http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a4.htm</ref>      A family is said to be [[society]]'s smallest unit, its nucleus. Family life is more private and intimate than public life. But in most countries there are laws for it. For example, there are restrictions for marrying within the family and bans for having a sexual relationship with [[relative]]s, especially with children.  == Types of families ==  Three types of family are: ''nuclear family'', ''single-parent family'' and ''extended family''.  #A '''nuclear family''' is made up of parents and one or more [[child]]ren living together. #A '''single-parent family''' is one where there is one parent and one or more children. #'''An extended family''' or '''joint families''' means [[father]], [[mother]], [[daughter]]s, [[son]]s, [[grandparent]]s, [[uncle]]s, [[aunt]]s, [[cousin]]s, [[Nephew and niece|nieces and nephews]]. In many countries including [[China]], Pakistan and [[India]], extended or joint families traditionally live together.  Both the "nuclear family" and the "single-parent family" are also called the "immediate family".   [[Foster care|Foster families]] are families where a child lives with and is cared for by people who are not his or her parents.  == Closeness == Some family members are related closer to each other. [[Consanguinity]] is a way of measuring this closeness.   {|class="wikitable" !Degree of<br />relationship!!Relationship!!Coefficient of<br />relationship (r) |- |0|| identical twins; clones || 100% (2<sup>0</sup>) |- |0|| individual-self || 100% (2<sup>0</sup>) |- |1|| mother / father / daughter / son <ref>{{cite web|url=http://taumoda.com/web/PD/library/kin.html|title=Kin Selection|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings|accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref> || 50% (2<sup>1</sup>) |- |2|| half-sister / half-brother || 25% (2<sup>2</sup>) |- |2|| sister / brother || 50% (22<sup>2</sup>) |- |2|| 3/4-sister / 3/4-brother || 37.5% (2<sup>2</sup>+2<sup>3</sup>) |- |2|| grandmother / grandfather / granddaughter / grandson || 25% (2<sup>2</sup>) |- |3|| half-aunt / half-uncle / half-niece / half-nephew || 12.5% (2<sup>3</sup>) |- |3|| aunt / uncle / niece / nephew || 25% (22<sup>3</sup>) |- |4|| half-cousin || 6.25% (2<sup>4</sup>) |- |4|| cousin || 12.5% (22<sup>4</sup>) |- |4|| sesqui-cousin || 18.75% (32<sup>4</sup>) |- |4|| double-cousin || 25% (42<sup>4</sup>) |- |3|| great-grandmother / great-grandfather / great-granddaughter / great-grandson || 12.5% (2<sup>3</sup>) |- |4|| half-grandaunt / half-granduncle / half-grandniece / half-grandnephew || 6.25% (2<sup>4</sup>) |- |4|| grandaunt / granduncle / grandniece / grandnephew || 12.5% (22<sup>4</sup>) |- |5|| half-once-removed || 3.125% (2<sup>5</sup>) |- |5|| single-once-removed || 6.25% (22<sup>5</sup>) |- |5|| sesqui-once-removed || 9.375% (32<sup>5</sup>) |- |5|| double-once-removed || 12.5% (42<sup>5</sup>) |- |6|| half-second-cousin || 1.5625% (2<sup>6</sup>) |}  '''Notes''': {{Reflist}}  [[Category:Human behavior]] [[Category:Social groups]]</text>
