They do not use [[light]] to get [[energy]] as [[plants]] do. Animals use different ways to get energy from other living things. They may eat other living things, though some are [[parasitism|parasites]] or have [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[protist]]s as [[symbiosis|symbionts]].  Most animals are [[motile|mobile]], meaning they can move around. Animals take in [[oxygen]], and give out [[carbon dioxide]].<ref>Cresswell, Julia 2010. ''The Oxford Dictionary of word origins''. 2nd ed, New York: Oxford University Press. ISBN 978-0-19-954793-7 'having the breath of life', from anima 'air, breath, life'.</ref> This [[cellular respiration]] is part of their [[metabolism]] (chemical working). In both these ways they are different from [[plants]]. Also, the cells of animals have different [[cell membrane]]s to other [[eukaryotes]] like plants and [[fungi]]. The study of animals is called [[zoology]].<ref>Alexander, R. McNeill 1990. ''Animals''. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge. IBSN 0-521-34865-X</ref><ref>Ville C.A; Walker W.F. & Barnes R.D. 1984.

The common animals most [[people]] know are only about 3% of the animal kingdom. When [[biologists]] look at animals, they find things that certain animals have in common. They use this to group the animals in a [[biological classification]]. They think several million species exist but they have only identified about one million.  Animals can mainly be divided into two main groups: the [[invertebrate]]s and the [[vertebrate]]s. Vertebrates have a [[backbone]], or [[spine]]; invertebrates do not.  Vertebrates are: *[[fish]] (or 'fishes': both ways are correct) *[[amphibian]]s *[[reptile]]s *[[bird]]s *[[mammal]]s  Some invertebrates are: *[[insect]]s *[[spider]]s *[[crustacean]]s *[[mollusc]]s (like a [[snail]] or [[squid]]) *[[worm]]s *[[jellyfish]]  In scientific usage, humans are considered animals, in everyday nonscientific usage, humans are often not considered to be animals.  ==Life styles== The animal mode of [[nutrition]] is called [[heterotroph]]ic because they get their food from other living organisms. Some animals eat only plants; they are called [[herbivore]]s. Other animals eat only [[meat]] and are called [[carnivore]]s. Animals that eat both plants and meat are called [[omnivore]]s.  The [[environments]] animals live in vary greatly. By the process of [[evolution]], animals [[Adaptation|adapt]] to the [[habitats]] they live in. A [[fish]] is adapted to its life in water and a [[spider]] is adapted to a life catching and eating insects. A [[mammal]] living on the [[savannah]]s of [[East Africa]] lives quite a different life from a [[dolphin]] or [[porpoise]] catching fish in the sea.  The [[fossil]] record of animals goes back about 600 million years to the [[Ediacaran]] period, or somewhat earlier.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maloof, Adam C.
