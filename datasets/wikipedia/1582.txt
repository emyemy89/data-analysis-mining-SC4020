<title>Tokyo</title><text>{{otheruses}} {{Nihongo|'''Tokyo'''||Tky|"Eastern Capital"}} is the capital and largest city of Japan located on the island of [[Honshu]]. Tokyo is the center of the Japanese government. The [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]] is in Tokyo.  Tokyo is the center of business, trade, and [[industry]] of Japan and also of [[Asia]]. The city is the center of the largest [[metropolitan area]] in the world. It faces Tokyo Bay.  It became the [[Capital (city)|capital city]] of Japan in the middle of [[19th century]], when its name changed from "[[Edo]]" to "Tokyo". Before then, [[Kyoto]] was the capital of Japan. The [[Emperor of Japan]], or [[Tenno]], lived in Kyoto. Edo was the place where the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] [[Shogun]]s lived. The city grew up under the control of the [[shogun]]s. Before then it was a small town on the sea. Edo means "the mouth of a river" in Japanese. [[File:Location TokyoJapan.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Tokyo]] Tokyo was destroyed by fires started by the [[1923 Great Kant earthquake|Great Kant earthquake in 1923]]. It was also badly damaged by [[bomb]]s during [[World War II]]. After Japan lost the war, the city was rebuilt.  == History == ===1457-1869=== {{Main|Edo}} Tokyo began as a small fishing village named Edo. Edo was in the old [[Musashi Province]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 780|page=780}}.</ref>  The Edo clan built walls to protect the town in the late 12th century. In 1457, ta Dkan built [[Edo Castle]]. In 1590, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] made Edo his base. He became [[shogun]] in 1603, and the town became the center of his military government. This marked the beginning of the [[Edo period]]. During this time, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world. More than one million people lived there by the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo and Paris: Urban Life and the State in the Early Modern Era |last=McClain, James | display-authors = etal |first=James |year=1994 |page=13 }}</ref>  Edo was not the [[capital of Japan]]. The emperor lived in the capital, [[Kyoto]]. However, since the shogun was more powerful than the emperor throughout Japanese history, Edo had more power.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Making of Urban Japan: Cities and Planning from Edo to the Twenty First Century |last=Sorensen |first=Andre |year=2004 |page=16 }}</ref> After about 263 years, the [[Meiji Restoration]] removed the shogun from power. In 1869, the 17-year-old [[Emperor Meiji]] moved to Edo. The old Edo Castle became the Kokyo, the Imperial Palace.  ===1869-1943=== {{Main|Tokyo, Tokyo}} The [[Tokyo Prefecture]] and the city of Tokyo were established. This was the capital city until 1943.  ===1943-present=== In 1943, Tokyo City and the "[[wikt:associated|associated]] municipalities of what was formerly {{Nihongo|[[Tokyo Prefecture]]||Tky-fu}} (1869-1943)" combined into one.  Central Tokyo is built around major railway stations. Suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level. There are some [[highway|expressways]].  Tokyo suffered two major catastrophes in the 20th century. The [[1923 Great Kant earthquake]] left 140,000 dead or missing.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1421140/Tokyo-Yokohama-earthquake-of-1923 Tokyo-Yokohama earthquake of 1923]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.</ref> [[World War II]] was the other disaster for the city. The Bombing of Tokyo from 1944 through 1945 killed between 75,000 and 200,000 people and destroyed half the city. This was almost as much damage as the atomic bombs of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] combined.<ref>{{cite book |title=Modern Japan: A Social and Political History |url=https://archive.org/details/modernjapansocia0000tipt |author=Tipton, Elise K. |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |page=[https://archive.org/details/modernjapansocia0000tipt/page/141 141] |isbn=0585453225}}</ref>  Tokyo was completely rebuilt after the war. The [[1964 Summer Olympics]] were a major world event. New high-rise developments such as Sunshine 60 started in the 1970s.  ==Climate== Tokyo has a four-[[season]] climate with rainy summers and dry winters. {{Weather box|location = temachi,<ref>The JMA Tokyo, Tokyo () station is at 3541.4N 13945.6E, JMA: [http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/select/prefecture.php?prec_no=44&block_no=47662&year=&month=&day=&view= >>>]</ref> Chiyoda ward, Tokyo (19812010) |metric first = Y |single line = Y |collapsed = Y |Jan record high C = 22.6 |Feb record high C = 24.9 |Mar record high C = 25.3 |Apr record high C = 29.2 |May record high C = 31.9 |Jun record high C = 36.2 |Jul record high C = 39.5 |Aug record high C = 39.1 |Sep record high C = 38.1 |Oct record high C = 32.6 |Nov record high C = 27.3 |Dec record high C = 24.8 |year record high C = 39.5 |Jan high C = 9.6 |Feb high C = 10.4 |Mar high C = 13.6 |Apr high C = 19.0 |May high C = 22.9 |Jun high C = 25.5 |Jul high C = 29.2 |Aug high C = 30.8 |Sep high C = 26.9 |Oct high C = 21.5 |Nov high C = 16.3 |Dec high C = 11.9 |year high C = 19.8 |Jan mean C = 5.2 |Feb mean C = 5.7 |Mar mean C = 8.7 |Apr mean C = 13.9 |May mean C = 18.2 |Jun mean C = 21.4 |Jul mean C = 25.0 |Aug mean C = 26.4 |Sep mean C = 22.8 |Oct mean C = 17.5 |Nov mean C = 12.1 |Dec mean C = 7.6 |year mean C = 15.4 |Jan low C = 0.9 |Feb low C = 1.7 |Mar low C = 4.4 |Apr low C = 9.4 |May low C = 14.0 |Jun low C = 18.0 |Jul low C = 21.8 |Aug low C = 23.0 |Sep low C = 19.7 |Oct low C = 14.2 |Nov low C = 8.3 |Dec low C = 3.5 |year low C = 11.6 |Jan record low C = -9.2 |Feb record low C = -7.9 |Mar record low C = -5.6 |Apr record low C = -3.1 |May record low C = 2.2 |Jun record low C = 8.5 |Jul record low C = 13.0 |Aug record low C = 15.4 |Sep record low C = 10.5 |Oct record low C = -0.5 |Nov record low C = -3.1 |Dec record low C = -6.8 |year record low C = -9.3 |precipitation colour = green |Jan precipitation mm = 52.3 |Feb precipitation mm = 56.1 |Mar precipitation mm = 117.5 |Apr precipitation mm = 124.5 |May precipitation mm = 137.8 |Jun precipitation mm = 167.7 |Jul precipitation mm = 153.5 |Aug precipitation mm = 168.2 |Sep precipitation mm = 209.9 |Oct precipitation mm = 197.8 |Nov precipitation mm = 92.5 |Dec precipitation mm = 51.0 |year precipitation mm = 1528.8 |Jan snow cm = 5 |Feb snow cm = 5 |Mar snow cm = 1 |Apr snow cm = 0 |May snow cm = 0 |Jun snow cm = 0 |Jul snow cm = 0 |Aug snow cm = 0 |Sep snow cm = 0 |Oct snow cm = 0 |Nov snow cm = 0 |Dec snow cm = 0 |year snow cm = 11 |Jan humidity = 52 |Feb humidity = 53 |Mar humidity = 56 |Apr humidity = 62 |May humidity = 69 |Jun humidity = 75 |Jul humidity = 77 |Aug humidity = 73 |Sep humidity = 75 |Oct humidity = 68 |Nov humidity = 65 |Dec humidity = 56 |year humidity = 62 |unit precipitation days = 0.5&nbsp;mm |Jan precipitation days = 5.3 |Feb precipitation days = 6.2 |Mar precipitation days = 11.0 |Apr precipitation days = 11.0 |May precipitation days = 11.4 |Jun precipitation days = 12.7 |Jul precipitation days = 11.8 |Aug precipitation days = 9.0 |Sep precipitation days = 12.2 |Oct precipitation days = 10.8 |Nov precipitation days = 7.6 |Dec precipitation days = 4.9 |year precipitation days = 114.0 |Jan snow days = 2.8 |Feb snow days = 3.7 |Mar snow days = 2.2 |Apr snow days = 0.2 |May snow days = 0.0 |Jun snow days = 0.0 |Jul snow days = 0.0 |Aug snow days = 0.0 |Sep snow days = 0.0 |Oct snow days = 0.0 |Nov snow days = 0.0 |Dec snow days = 0.8 |year snow days = 9.7 |Jan sun = 184.5 |Feb sun = 165.8 |Mar sun = 163.1 |Apr sun = 176.9 |May sun = 167.8 |Jun sun = 125.4 |Jul sun = 146.4 |Aug sun = 169.0 |Sep sun = 120.9 |Oct sun = 131.0 |Nov sun = 147.9 |Dec sun = 178.0 |year sun = 1876.7 |source 1 = Japan Meteorological Agency (records 1872present)<ref name= JMA>{{cite web | url = http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/nml_sfc_ym.php?prec_no=44&prec_ch=%93%8C%8B%9E%93s&block_no=47662&block_ch=%93%8C%8B%9E&year=&month=&day=&elm=normal&view= | title=/ | publisher = [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] | language = ja | access-date = December 16, 2014}}</ref><ref name= JMA1>{{cite web | url = http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/nml_sfc_ym.php?prec_no=44&block_no=47662&year=&month=&day=&view=a1 | title=/ | publisher = [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] | language = ja | access-date = December 16, 2014}}</ref><ref name= JMArecords>{{cite web | url = http://www.data.jma.go.jp/obd/stats/etrn/view/rank_s.php?prec_no=44&block_no=47662&year=&month=13&day=&view= | title=110 | publisher = [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] | language = ja | access-date = December 16, 2014}}</ref> }}  ==Population== {| class="toccolours"  cellpadding="4" cellspacing="1" style="float:right;

On July 1, 1943, Tokyo City was merged with {{Nihongo|Tokyo Prefecture||Tky-fu}} to become a special government area. This made the wards different from other wards in Japan. Other [[wards of Japan|city wards]] are part of a larger city government, but these are not. Each ward is a [[Municipalities in Japan|municipality]] with its own mayor and assembly like the other cities of Japan. The special wards often use the word city in their official English name, e.g. Chiyoda City.  The wards have a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government.  The Tokyo Metropolitan Government manages some public works such as water, sewer, and fire-fighting. To pay for these things, the prefecture collects the municipal taxes usually collected by a city.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060708203323/http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/PROFILE/overview06.htm The Structure of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government] (Tokyo government webpage)</ref>  The special wards of Tokyo are: {| |- style="vertical-align:top;" | * [[Adachi, Tokyo|Adachi]] * [[Arakawa, Tokyo|Arakawa]] * [[Bunky, Tokyo|Bunky]] * [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]] * [[Ch, Tokyo|Ch]] * [[Edogawa, Tokyo|Edogawa]] * [[Itabashi, Tokyo|Itabashi]] * [[Katsushika, Tokyo|Katsushika]] | * [[Kita, Tokyo|Kita]] * [[Kt, Tokyo|Kt]] * [[Meguro, Tokyo|Meguro]] * [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]] * [[Nakano, Tokyo|Nakano]] * [[Nerima, Tokyo|Nerima]] * [[ta, Tokyo|ta]] * Setagaya | * [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] * [[Shinagawa, Tokyo|Shinagawa]] * [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]] * [[Suginami, Tokyo|Suginami]] * [[Sumida, Tokyo|Sumida]] * [[Tait, Tokyo|Tait]] * Toshima |}  Three wards of Tokyo make up the central part of the city.

There are very few buildings in Tokyo that are more than 50 years old. Popular places for visitors range from [[Tokyo Tower]] in the center of the city to [[Mount Takao]] out in the western countryside. [[Tokyo Skytree]] is a new tower and is the tallest in Japan. Traditional religious sights such as [[Meiji Shrine]] and [[Sens-ji]] attract many tourists. The Imperial Palace can be seen in the middle of the city, but is not open to the public.  == Transportation == Tokyo is the cultural, business, and political center of the country. It is also the center of many transport systems. There are many air, rail, sea, and road links in and out of the city. Local subway and bus systems serve every part of the city.  Two commercial '''airports''' serve Tokyo. [[Haneda Airport]] is in the city limits next to [[Tokyo Bay]]. This airport is mostly for domestic travel. Most international flights to and from Tokyo go through Narita Airport in [[Chiba Prefecture]].  Several [[Shinkansen]] '''super-express railway '''lines begin at [[Tokyo Station]], including the  [[Tkaid Shinkansen]] going west and Thoku Shinkansen going northeast. [[Tokyo Metro]] is the city's major [[subway]] system.  Tokyo has a busy international and domestic '''port''', but more traffic goes through the nearby port of [[Yokohama]]. There are domestic ferries to the islands of Tokyo, but also to other parts of the country such as [[Hokkaido]].  Many '''highways''' meet in Tokyo, including: the Ch, Kan-Etsu, Thoku, and Tmei Expressways. All highway distances in Japan start from zero at a marker in Nihonbashi, Tokyo.  ==Related pages== * [[F.C.
