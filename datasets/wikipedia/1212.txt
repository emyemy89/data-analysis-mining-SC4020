According to the [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]],<ref>Wald, Robert M. 1984. ''General Relativity''. University of Chicago Press. ISBN 978-0-226-87033-5</ref> it is the result of the curving of [[spacetime]] caused by a huge [[mass]]. Around a black hole there is a position of no return, called the [[event horizon]]. It is called "black" because it absorbs all the light that hits it, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect [[black body]] in [[thermodynamics]].  The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the [[event horizon]].  Under the theory of [[quantum mechanics]] black holes have a [[temperature]] and emit [[Hawking radiation]], which makes them slowly get smaller.  A black hole is found by its interaction with [[matter]]. The presence of a black hole can be [[inference (grammar)|worked out]] by tracking the movement of a group of stars that orbit a region in space. Alternatively, when gas falls into a black hole, the gas spirals inward, heating to very high temperatures and emitting large amounts of [[radiation]]. This radiation can be detected from earthbound and [[Earth]]-orbiting [[telescope]]s. Inside a black hole the rules of physics are very different.<ref>Wald, Robert M. 1992.

For a small thing, like a [[rocket]], to escape from a larger thing, like [[Earth]], it has to escape the pull of our gravity or it will fall back. The speed that it must travel upward to get away from Earth's gravity is called [[escape velocity]]. Bigger planets (like [[Jupiter]]) and stars have more mass, and have stronger gravity than Earth. Therefore, the escape velocity is much faster. John Michell thought it was possible for something to be so big that the escape velocity would be faster than the [[speed of light]], so even light could not escape.<ref name="Michell1784"> {{Cite journal|last=Michell J. 1784|title=On the means of discovering the distance, magnitude, &c. of the fixed stars, in consequence of the diminution of the velocity of their light, in case such a diminution should be found to take place in any of them, and such other data should be procured from observations, as would be farther necessary for that purpose |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=74 |issue=0 |pages=3557 |bibcode=1784RSPT...74...35M|doi=10.1098/rstl.1784.0008 |ref=harv |jstor=106576 }}</ref> In 1796, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] promoted the same idea in the first and second editions of his book ''Exposition du systme du Monde'' (it was removed from later editions).<ref>{{cite book| last=Gillispie C.C. 2000 | title=Pierre-Simon Laplace, 17491827: a life in exact science | series=Princeton paperbacks | page=175 | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn=0-691-05027-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iohJomX0IWgC&pg=PA175 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Israel W. 1989|chapter=Dark stars: the evolution of an idea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq787qC5PWQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA199#v=onepage&q&f=false |editor1-last=Hawking |editor1-first=S.

His theory was forgotten.  In 1916 [[Albert Einstein]] wrote an explanation of gravity called [[general relativity]]. * Mass causes space (and [[spacetime]]) to bend, or curve. Moving things "fall along" or follow the curves in space. This is what we call gravity. * Light always travels at the same speed, and is affected by gravity. If it seems to change speed, it is really traveling along a curve in spacetime.

A distant observer sees the material falling in slowly and then stop just above the event horizon because of [[gravitational time dilation]]. The light emitted just before the event horizon is delayed an infinite amount of time. So the observer never sees the formation of the event horizon. Instead, the collapsing material seems to become dimmer and increasingly [[red shift|red-shifted]], eventually fading away.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Penrose, Roger 2002 |title=Gravitational collapse:the role of general relativity|journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |volume=34 |issue=7 |page=1141 |doi=10.1023/A:1016578408204|url=http://www.imamu.edu.sa/Scientific_selections/abstracts/Physics/Gravitational%20Collapse%20The%20Role%20of%20General.pdf|bibcode = 2002GReGr..34.1141P }}</ref>  == Supermassive black holes == {{main|Supermassive black hole}} Black holes have also been found in the middle of almost every [[galaxy]] in the known [[universe]]. These are called [[supermassive black hole]]s (SBH), and are the biggest black holes of all. They formed when the Universe was very young, and also helped to form all the galaxies.  [[Quasars]] are believed to be powered by gravity collecting material into supermassive black  in the centers of distant galaxies. Light cannot escape the SBHs at the center of quasars, so the escaping energy is made outside the [[event horizon]] by gravitational stresses and immense [[friction]] on the incoming material.<ref>Thomsen D.E. 1987. End of the World: you won't feel a thing. ''Science News'' '''131''' (25): 391.</ref>  Huge central masses (10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> solar masses) have been measured in quasars. Several dozen nearby large galaxies, with no sign of a quasar nucleus, contain a similar central black hole in their nuclei. Therefore, it is thought that all large galaxies have one, but only a small fraction are active (with enough accretion to power radiation) and so are seen as quasars.  == Effect on light == [[File:Accretion disk.jpg|thumb|Artist's image: a black hole pulling off the outer layer of a nearby star. It is surrounded by an energy disk, which is making a jet of [[radiation]].]] [[File:Einstein_cross.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Einstein's Cross]]: four images from one [[quasar]]]]  At the middle of a black hole, there is a gravitational center called a [[singularity]]. It is impossible to see into it because the gravity prevents any light escaping. Around the tiny singularity, there is a large area where light which would normally pass by gets sucked in as well. The edge of this area is called the [[event horizon]]. The area beyond the event horizon is the black hole. The gravity of the black hole gets weaker at a distance. The event horizon is the place farthest away from the middle where the gravity is still strong enough to trap light.  Outside the event horizon, light and matter will still be pulled toward the black hole. If a black hole is surrounded by matter, the matter will form an "accretion disk" (accretion means "gathering") around the black hole. An accretion disk looks something like the rings of [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]. As it gets sucked in, the matter gets very hot and shoots [[x-ray]] [[radiation]] into space. Think of this as the water spinning around the hole before it falls in.  Most black holes are too far away for us to see the accretion disk and jet. The only way to know a black hole is there is by seeing how [[star]]s, [[gas]] and light behave around it. With a black hole nearby, even objects as big as a star move in a different way, usually faster than they would if the black hole was not there.  Since we cannot see black holes, they must be detected by other means. When a black hole passes between us and a source of light, the light bends around the black hole creating a mirror image. That effect is called [[gravitational lensing]].<ref>Soldner J.G.V. 1804.

It is named after the physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], who provided a theoretical argument for its existence in 1974.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.charlierose.com/guest/view/6294 |title=Charlie Rose: A conversation with Dr. Stephen Hawking & Lucy Hawking |access-date=2012-11-29 |archive-date=2013-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329060031/http://www.charlierose.com/guest/view/6294 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Hawking radiation reduces the mass and the energy of the black hole and is therefore also known as ''black hole evaporation''. This happens because of the virtual particle-antiparticle pairs. Due to quantum fluctuations, this is when one of the particles falls in and the other gets away with the energy/mass. Because of this, black holes that lose more mass than they gain through other means are expected to shrink and ultimately vanish. [[Micro black hole]]s (MBHs) are predicted to be larger net emitters of radiation than larger black holes and should shrink and dissipate faster.  == Properties of black holes == The [[no hair conjecture]] is that, when it has become stable, a black hole has only three independent physical properties: [[mass]], [[Electric charge|charge]], and [[angular momentum]]. If the conjecture is true, any two black holes that have the same values for these three properties, cannot be distinguished, they look the same. As of 2020, it is unclear if the no hair conjecture is true for real black holes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chruciel|first=Piotr T.|last2=Costa|first2=Joo Lopes|last3=Heusler|first3=Markus|date=2012|title=Stationary Black Holes: Uniqueness and Beyond|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5255892/|journal=Living Reviews in Relativity|volume=15|issue=1|doi=10.12942/lrr-2012-7|issn=1433-8351|pmc=5255892|pmid=28179837}}</ref>  The properties are special, because all three can be measured from outside the black hole. For example, a charged black hole repels other like charges just like any other charged object. Similarly, the total mass inside a sphere containing a black hole can be found by using the gravitational analog of [[Gauss's law]], far away from the black hole.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Carroll |first1=Sean M. |title=Spacetime and Geometry |url=https://archive.org/details/spacetimegeometr00carr |date=2004 |publisher=Addison Wesley |isbn=978-0-8053-8732-2  |p=[https://archive.org/details/spacetimegeometr00carr/page/n264 253]}}.
