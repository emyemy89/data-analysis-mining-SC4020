<title>Computer mouse</title><text>[[File:3-Tasten-Maus Microsoft.jpg|thumb|Many mice have two buttons and a scroll wheel.]]  A '''computer mouse'''  is an [[input device]] that is used with a [[personal computer|computer]]. Moving a mouse along a flat [[surface]] can move the [[cursor]] to different items on the [[Computer monitor|screen]]. Items can be moved or selected by pressing the mouse [[Push-button|buttons]] (called [[wikt:click|clicking]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foldoc.org/mouse|title=mouse from FOLDOC|website=foldoc.org}}</ref> Today's mice have two buttons, the left button and right button, with a [[#Uses|scroll wheel]] in between the two. Today, many [[computer]] mice use [[Bluetooth|wireless]] technology and have no wire.  There are many types of mouse. Optical mouse, wireless mouse, mechanical mouse, trackball mouse. A computer mouse is a handheld hardware input device that controls a cursor in a GUI and can move and select text, icons, files, and folders. For desktop computers, the mouse is placed on a flat surface such as a mouse pad or a desk and is placed in front of your computer. The picture to the right is an example of a desktop computer mouse with two buttons and a wheel. The mouse was originally known as the X-Y position Indicator for a display system and was invented by [[Douglas Engelbart]] in 1963 while working at [[Xerox PARC]]. However, due to Alto's lack of success, the first widely used application of the mouse was with the [[Apple Lisa]] computer.                             Today this device is on virtually every computer. The primary function is to move the mouse pointer on the screen. The mouse pointer can be used for many actions on the computer. Clicking or double clicking an icon, folder, or other object will open a document or execute the program. Users can also move an icon, folder, or other object by clicking a mouse button and dragging the object with the mouse pointer. Pointing to an item on the screen means moving your mouse so the pointer appears to be touching the item. When you point to something, a small box often appears that describes the item.  == History == In 1964 [[Douglas Engelbart]] (1925-2013), a researcher at [[Stanford University|Stanford Research Institute]], wanted to find a way to make using computers easier. In those days, computers were large and expensive. Using them was very hard because everything had to be typed in on a [[keyboard (computer)|keyboard]]. This [[command line interface]] is still used by some people, such as [[programmer]]s, to get things done faster.  After studying and designing for a long time, Engelbart succeeded in inventing an input device which he named 'XY index'. At first, it needed two [[hand]]s to use, but it was changed so that only one hand was needed to use it. This model was more like the mouse that we use today, but was made up of [[Trackball|a big ball]] that the user had to roll in different [[direction]]s to move the cursor.  [[File:Apple II mouse.jpg|thumb|left|Early Apple II mouse with a single button]] The computer mouse began to be widely used when [[Xerox]] Palo Alto Research introduced a [[Graphical user interfaces and consoles|GUI]] in 1981, where the mouse was used to click things on the screen. This was also the case with the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] [[operating system]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]<ref>[http://computer.howstuffworks.com/mouse.htm/printable How computer mice work]: "... the mouse hit the scene - attached to the Mac..."</ref> of [[Apple Inc]] when it came out in 1984, as well as [[Microsoft Windows]]. Windows became popular over the years, so over time computer mice became used with many computers.  In 1991, the company [[Logitech]] invented the wireless mouse.<ref name="sutori-wirelessmouse">https://www.sutori.com/story/history-of-the-computer-mouse--2KWUavjKLozs9P8VsV8znyoQ</ref><ref name="logitech-macworld">https://www.macworld.com/article/1137400/mouse40.html</ref> Unlike a normal mouse, wireless mice were connected by radio signals.<ref name="sutori-wirelessmouse" /><ref name="logitech-macworld" /> Newer wireless mice use [[Bluetooth]] or [[WiFi]] to connect wireless mice to computers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://10hotdeals.com/best-mouse/ |title=Computer Mouse - 10HD |work=10hotdeals.com}}</ref>  == Uses == On most computers, the user can move the mouse to move the cursor in the same direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=computer+mouse|title=WordNet Search - 3.1|website=wordnetweb.princeton.edu}}</ref> To choose something that is on the screen,  the user can move the cursor to it and "click" the left mouse button. The right  button is used to open menus that are different depending on where the cursor is. The other mouse buttons can do different things, depending on the [[software]]. Most mice have two buttons to click.   Most mice also have the "scroll wheel"a small wheel found between the two main mouse buttons. The user can move the wheel back and forth to "scroll" through things like a [[website]] or folder. "Scrolling" means moving the words or pictures up or down on the screen, so another part of the page comes into view. The wheel can also be pressed, to click it like another button.  A mouse can also be connected to and used the same way with a [[laptop]] computer, but unlike a [[desktop computer]], one does not have to be connected to use the laptop. This is because along with the keyboard, laptops have a built-in input device called a [[trackpad]] which does the same thing as a mouse. Similarly, [[tablet computer]]s have a [[touchscreen]] as an input device, but some, like the [[Microsoft Surface]] and those that use [[Android (operating system)|Android]], also work with mice.  == Related pages == * [[Touchpad]] * [[Trackball]] * [[Touchscreen]]  == References == {{reflist}}  == Other websites == * [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Mouse_(computing) Mouse (computing)] Citizendium   {{Tech-stub}}  [[Category:Computer hardware]] [[Category:Data input]]</text>
