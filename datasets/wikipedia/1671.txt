Many people wrongly thought that all Jews became rich by stealing money from other people, such as [[Christianity|Christians]]; that they did not like people other than their fellow Jews; and that they harmed children to use their blood for religious rituals ([[blood libel]]). These beliefs were not true, and were based on [[stereotype]]s and [[prejudice]]s.  However these beliefs were popular in the [[German language|German]]-speaking world and elsewhere in the late 1800s.  [[Adolf Hitler]] was born in [[Austria]] during this time, when many people disliked Jews. He may have been [[jealousy|jealous]] of Jewish success in Austria. However, in a book he wrote called ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' ("My Struggle"), he said it was the Jews' fault that [[Germany]] and Austria lost [[World War I]]. He also wrote that Germany's [[economy|economic]] problems were the Jews' fault.

Led by Hitler, the Nazis [[mass murder|killed millions]] of Jews. They forced Jews to wear the golden [[Star of David]] on their upper bodies. Jews were rounded up by the thousands and crammed into [[train]]s that took them to concentration camps like [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] as well as [[Extermination camp|death camps]]. Most of the Jews killed in the Holocaust were not [[Germany|German]]. They were from [[Poland]] or the [[Soviet Union]].  The Nazis killed millions of people, hundreds at a time, with [[poison gas]] in special rooms called gas chambers. They forced others to dig giant holes in the ground where, after days of hard work, Jews and other prisoners were shot, buried, and burned in a mass [[grave]]. The Nazis [[execution|executed]] many others by [[shooting]], stabbing, or beating them to death. Still others died in [[wikt:forced march|forced marches]] from one camp to another.  Many other people died of [[starvation]], [[disease]]s, and [[hypothermia|freezing to death]] because of the terrible conditions in the concentration camps.  On the other hand, there were people who saved Jews from the Holocaust, because they thought it was the right thing to do.
