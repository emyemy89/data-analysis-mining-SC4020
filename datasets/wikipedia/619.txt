<title>MediaWiki:Blockiptext</title><text>{{Template:Sensitive IP addresses}} <div id="blockiptext" class="blockiptext"> You can use this form to block editing access and account creation from individual accounts or IPs in accordance with the [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocking policy]].  '''Please remember to include an informative reason for blocking.''' When using the pull-down menu, please also elaborate on the following line whenever helpful (citing relevant policy pages, [[Wikipedia:Sock puppetry|sock puppet]] accounts, the nature of the [[Wikipedia:Disruptive editing|disruption]], etc.). Use civil, appropriate, and professional diction. Keep in mind that the block message will be very visible when someone tries to edit Wikipedia through the blocked account or IP.  * When blocking legitimate '''bot accounts''', please ensure that you ''disable autoblocks'' to avoid blocking the bot owner.  <i>Related pages:  [[Special:Log/block|Block log]],  [[Special:Blocklist|List of active blocks and rangeblocks]],  <span class="plainlinks">[{{fullurl:Special:BlockList|action=unblock}} Unblock form]</span>,  [[toollabs:ip-range-calc|Range block calculator]], [[toollabs:xtools/autoblock|Auto-block check]], <!--[[tools:~overlordq/scripts/checktor.fcgi|Tor check]], -->[[Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace#Blocks|List of block message templates]].</i> <div id="readthispart" class="readthispart">  === IP addresses === * '''In general:''' Most [[IP address]]es should not be blocked for more than a few days, as they may be reassigned to innocent users. Only in rare cases should IPs be blocked indefinitely. For detailed information on blocking IP addresses, please see [[Wikipedia:Blocking IP addresses]]. * '''Shared IPs:''' Before blocking an IP address with a long history of vandalism, please check if it is a shared [[proxy server]] or part of a dynamic IP address pool.<br />See [[Wikipedia:Blocking IP addresses#Shared IPs|here]] for details on how to identify and tag such addresses. When blocking, please ensure that ''Prevent logged-in users from editing from this IP address'' is unchecked to limit [[collateral damage]] to innocent users. * <span style="color: #F00;">'''Blocks of governmental IP ranges:'''</span> If you block ''any'' IP in the ranges listed above under the "Sensitive IP addresses" table, you ''must'' notify the [[meta:Communications committee|Wikimedia Foundation Communications Committee]] immediately (see contact instructions there or use [[meta:Communications committee/Notifications|the notifications page]]). These ranges are allocated to major governmental organizations; blocks of these organizations have political and public relations implications of which the Foundation's press relations team must be aware. Avoid long blocks of these addresses, and '''be especially careful in formulating your block messages''' because your block message will probably be seen and commented on by the press. </div> ---- __NOTOC____NOEDITSECTION__ </div></text>
