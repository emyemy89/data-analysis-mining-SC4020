The other parties in the Duma (Russian parliament) do not criticize the government strongly, for fear of losing their places in the Duma. Many opposition parties, such as the [[People's Freedom Party]] and the [[Other Russia]], have been unable to register due to the strict rules. In the 2000s the government led a war in [[Chechnya]], and in the process, [[civil liberties]] and independent media were restricted. Corruption is widespread and human rights, especially in the [[North Caucasus]], are frequently violated. In 2008 Putin's government was in a [[2008 South Ossetia war|war with Georgia]] in a dispute over a region with many ethnic Russians.  == History == [[File:Peter der-Grosse 1838.jpg|upright|thumbnail|left|[[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] proclaimed the [[Russian Empire]] in 1721]] The roots of Russia's history began when the [[Slavic peoples|East Slavs]] formed a group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD.<ref name=britannica>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109504/Russia|title=Russia|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref> The [[Viking]]s and their [[descendant]]s founded the first East Slavic state of [[Kievan Rus']] in the 9th century.

The most powerful successor state to Kievan Rus' was the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]]. This area served as the main force in later Russian unification and the fight against the [[Golden Horde]] from Asia. Moscow slowly gained control of the regions around it and took over the cultural and political life of Kievan Rus'.  In the 18th century, the nation had expanded through conquest, [[annexation]] and [[exploration]] to become the [[Russian Empire]], the third largest empire in history. It stretched from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] eastward to the [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Alaska]]. The empire was ruled by an [[emperor]] called the [[Tsar]].  [[Peter the Great]] ruled Russia from 1689 until 1725. Peter moved the capital from [[Moscow]] to a new city named [[Saint Petersburg]]. He made Russian society more modern in many ways. The government began building ships for the Russian navy.  The [[Russo-Japanese War]] started in 1904 and ended in 1905 with Japan winning the war. The Russian defeat was one of the reasons for later [[revolution]]s.  In [[October Revolution|October 1917]], the [[Bolshevik]]s (later called "Communists"), influenced by the ideas of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]], took over the country and murdered the [[Tsar]] and other people who stood against them. Once they took power, the Bolsheviks, under Vladimir Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]], created the first [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Communist]] State.  From the 1920s to the 1950s, [[Josef Stalin]] ruled as an absolute dictator of [[Soviet Russia]], and destroyed anything and anyone that was against his rule, including taking the property of farmers and shopkeepers.  Many millions of people starved and died in the resulting [[famine]]s.  Stalin also removed, or "purged", all military personnel who were not loyal to him, and many were killed or sent to prison camps, or [[gulag]]s, for many years. Even in the gulags, many prisoners died.  Soviet Russia and [[Nazi Germany]] agreed not to attack each other in 1939. In June 1941, Germany broke the agreement and attacked in [[Operation Barbarossa]]. The attack was part of [[World War II]]. The war lasted in Europe until May 1945, and Russia lost more than 20 million people during that time. In spite of this large loss, Russia was one of the winners of the war and became a world [[superpower]].  From 1922 to 1991, Russia was the largest part of the [[Soviet Union]], or the ''Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'' (USSR).
