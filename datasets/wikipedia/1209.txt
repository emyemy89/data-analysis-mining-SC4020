<title>Buddhism</title><text>{{Buddhism}}  '''Buddhism''' originated in [[India]], based on the teachings, of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], later known as [[Gautama Buddha]]. A [[Buddha]] is one who is said to be awake to the truth of life.   Over the centuries his teachings spread from [[Nepal]] to [[Central Asia]], [[Tibet]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[China]], [[Mongolia]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], and now [[Europe]] and [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]. [[Theravada]] Buddhism is most common in South Asia; [[Mahayana]] further north. Buddhism exists in many different strands today, but all schools and sects share basic ideas. About seven percent of the people of the world are Buddhist.   While many people see Buddhism as a religion,<ref>Chambers Dictionary, 2006; Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 2003; New Penguin Handbook of Living Religions, 1998; Dewey Decimal System of Book Classification</ref> others see it as a [[philosophy]], and others as a way of finding [[wikt:reality|reality]].<ref>For example: Thich Nhat Hanh, ''[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/241899.Old Path White Clouds|Old Path White Clouds]'' For example: Dorothy Figen, ''[http://www.buddhistinformation.com/is_buddhism_a_religion1.htm Is Buddhism a Religion?]{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''</ref><ref>For example: Narada Thera, ''Buddhism in a Nutshell,'' http://www.buddhanet.net/nutshell03.htm</ref>  == Background and Buddhist concepts == Siddhartha Gautama (563{{ndash}}483 [[BC]]) began life as the infant prince of a small kingdom in what is now the southern part of [[Nepal]]. As an adult he left wealth and status behind to search for truth. Enlightened at the age of 35, the Buddha spent the next 45 years of his life traveling and teaching in the northern part of India. He died at the age of 80.  The Buddha focused much of his teaching on how to overcome suffering. He saw that all living things suffer in being born, in getting sick, in growing old, and in facing death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/buddhism-4133165|title=Buddhism|website=ThoughtCo}}</ref> By overcoming suffering, he taught, a person will be truly happy.   '''Early teaching.''' His first lesson after becoming enlightened was to other seekers who had also renounced the world. This was a group of holy men or monks with whom the Buddha had studied for five or more years. To them he first presented what he saw as the Four Noble Truths of life and the Eightfold Noble Path (see below). These teachings identify the causes of suffering and their cure.  '''Three marks of existence.''' The Buddha taught that life is best understood as being ''impermanent'' (everything changes), ''unsatisfactory'' (left on our own we are never truly happy), and ''interdependent'' (all things are linked, even to the degree that the self is better understood as an illusion).   '''The middle way.''' Buddhism teaches non-harm and ''moderation'' or balance, not going too far one way or the other. This is called the Middle Way, and encourages people to live in balance.   '''Meditation.''' The Buddha recommended meditation as a way to discipline the mind and see the world as it is. Buddhists may [[meditation|meditate]] while sitting in a special or specific way. Standing and walking meditation are other styles.    '''Three poisons.''' In discussing suffering, the Buddha identified the three poisons of [[Samudaya sacca|desire, anger and stupidity]], and he showed that we could end our suffering by letting go of desires and overcoming anger and stupidity.   '''Nirvana.''' The complete letting go of negative influences is called [[Nirvana]], meaning "to extinguish," like putting out the flame of a candle. This end of suffering is also called [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|Enlightenment]]. In Buddhism, Enlightenment and Nirvana often mean the same thing.  '''Do Buddhists believe in god or gods?''' The Buddha would not say if [[Deity|gods]] exist or not, although gods play a part in some Buddhist stories. If someone asked the Buddha, "Do gods exist?" he maintained a ''noble silence''. That is, he would not confirm or deny. Buddhists do not believe that people should look to gods to save them or bring them enlightenment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.072.than.html|title=Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta: To Vacchagotta on Fire|website=www.accesstoinsight.org}}</ref> Rather individuals should work out their own path the best they can.   '''Other basic teachings.''' Many of the Buddha's ideas are found in other Indian religions, especially [[Hinduism]].   * '''Karma.''' [[Karma]] refers to actions, and the Buddha taught that actions have consequences for good or ill. If people make good decisions they will be happier and have more peace of mind.   :''"To avoid all evil'' :''To do good.'' :''To purify one's mind:'' ''This is the teaching of all the Buddhas."''  [[Dhammapada|Dhammapda]], XIV, 5  * '''Reincarnation.''' The Buddha taught about [[reincarnation]], the idea that after we die we are likely to be reborn in this world and face the same kind of suffering as in the past life.  The ultimate goal of a Buddhist is to find enlightenment (Nirvana) which places us beyond endless reincarnation and suffering.  Some Buddhists understand the idea in a poetic way, and not a literal one.  == Who is Buddha? == ''[[Buddha]]'' is a [[Pali]] word which means "'''The awakened one'''". Someone who has woken up to the truth of the mind and suffering and teaches the truth to others is called a Buddha. The word "Buddha" often means the historical Buddha named Buddha Shakyamuni ([[Siddhartha Gautama]]).<ref>see, for example, ''[[:en:Basic points unifying Theravda and Mahyna|Basic points unifying the Theravda and the Mahyna]].''</ref> Buddhists do not believe that a Buddha is a god, but that he is a human being who has woken up and can see the true way the mind works. They believe this knowledge totally changes the person. This person can help others become ''enlightened'' too. Enlightened people are beyond birth, death, and rebirth.   === Who was the first Buddha? === According to Buddhism, there were countless Buddhas before Gautama Buddha and there will be many Buddhas after him.   In Pali texts, the first Buddha in Buddhavamsa sutta was Tahakara Buddha. The Mahapadana sutta says the earliest Buddha of the recent seven buddhas was Vipassi Buddha (''But sutta is not saying that Vipassi is first Buddha''). Counting from the present ''[[kalpa]]'' (the beginning of our present world (Earth)) Gautama Buddha is considered the fourth Buddha. In this telling, the first is Kakusandho Buddha, second Konakamano Buddha, and the third Kassapo Buddha. The last Buddha of this ''[[kalpa]]'' will be [[Maitreya]] Buddha. Then the world (Earth) will renew itself and from then begins a new ''[[kalpa]]''.  == Beliefs of Buddhism == === The three jewels === ''{{Main|Three Jewels}}'' Buddhists respect and treasure the ''Three Jewels'', which are the Buddha, the [[Dharma]], and the [[Sangha]].  The Buddha refers to the awakened one, the Dharma to the Buddha's teachings, and the Sangha to the people who follow the Buddha and his teachings.   Buddhists say "I take ''refuge'' in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha." They find comfort in these jewels or treasures.   === Four noble Truths === ''{{Main|Four Noble Truths}}'' The Buddha's first and most important teachings are the [[Four Noble Truths]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Buswell| first = Robert E.| title = Encyclopedia of Buddhism| url = https://books.google.com/?id=5n0YAAAAIAAJ| year = 2004| publisher = Macmillan Reference USA/Thomson/Gale| isbn = 978-0-02-865720-2| page = 296 }}</ref> # Life is suffering.  # The reason for this suffering is that we want things to be a certain way. # The way to cure suffering is to rise above this desire. # The way to rise above desire is to follow the ''Noble Eightfold Path'', practices which help us change our minds and understanding.  <br />  === Noble Eightfold Path === ''{{Main|Noble Eightfold Path}}'' The Buddha told people to follow a special way of life called the ''Noble Eightfold Path'' if they want to understand the ''Four Noble Truths''. These are: # Appropriate views. Know and understand the Four Noble Truths # Appropriate thought. Turn your mind away from the world and towards the Dharma # Appropriate speech. Tell the truth, don't gossip, and don't talk badly about others # Appropriate conduct. Don't commit evil acts, like killing, stealing, or living an unclean life # Appropriate livelihood. Earn your money in a way that doesn't harm anyone # Appropriate effort. Work to make your mind more good and less evil # Appropriate mindfulness. Remember the Dharma and apply it all the time # Appropriate meditation. Practice meditation as a way of understanding reality  === Five precepts === Buddhists are encouraged to follow five ''precepts'', or guidelines. The Buddha taught that killing, stealing, having sex in a harmful way, and lying are not signs of skill.<ref>[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/gettingmessage.html Thanissaro (2006).]  Thanissaro, in part, references [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 9, ''Samm-di{{IAST|}}hi Sutta'', to support this statement.</ref>  # I will not hurt a person or animal that is alive. # I will not take something if it was not given to me. # I will not engage in sexual misconduct. # I will not lie or say things that hurt people. # I will not take ''intoxicants'', like [[alcohol]] or [[drug]]s, causing heedlessness.  If a person wants to be a monk or nun, he or she will follow other ''precepts'' as well.  == Further reading == * {{cite book| author=Bechert, Heinz | title=The World of Buddhism | publisher=Thames & Hudson | year=1984}} * {{cite book| last = Harvey| first = Peter| title = An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices| year = 1990| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-31333-9 }} * {{cite book| last = Armstrong| first = Karen| title = Buddha| year = 2001| publisher = Penguin Books| isbn = 978-0-14-303436-0| page = 187 }} * {{cite book| last = Gunaratana| first = Henepola| title = Mindfulness in Plain English| url = https://archive.org/details/mindfulnessi_guna_2002_000_10545944| year = 2002| publisher = Wisdom Publications| isbn = 978-0-86171-321-9 }} * {{cite book| last = Robinson| first = Richard Hugh| title = The Buddhist Religion: A Historical Introduction| url = https://archive.org/details/buddhistreligion0000robi_h9v3| year = 1982| publisher = Wadsworth Publishing| isbn = 978-0-534-01027-0 }} * {{cite book| last1 = Smith| first1 = Huston| last2 = Novak| first2 = Philip| title = Buddhism: A Concise Introduction| url = https://archive.org/details/buddhismconcisei00smit| year = 2003| publisher = HarperSanFrancisco| isbn = 978-0-06-073067-3 }}  ==Related pages == * [[Siddhartha Gautama]] * [[Buddha]] * [[Nichiren]] * [[Buddhist calendar]] * [[Criticism of Buddhism]]  == References == {{reflist}}  == Other websites == {{Wikisource1911Enc|Buddhism}} {{wikiquote}} {{Commons category}} {{wiktionary|Buddhism}} * [http://www.buddhist-events.org/ World Buddhist Events Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929224825/http://www.buddhist-events.org/ |date=2007-09-29 }} * [http://www.synaptic.bc.ca/ejournal/buddhist.htm Critical Resources: Buddha & Buddhism] * [http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/ Buddhist Channel] * [http://www.religioustolerance.org/buddhism.htm ReligiousTolerance - Buddhism] * [http://www.mrrena.com/budd.shtml A Study of Buddhism in Contrast to Christianity] (From a Western Christian perspective) * [http://www.what-Buddha-taught.net What Buddhism taught] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041702/http://what-buddha-taught.net/ |date=2007-09-28 }} * [http://www.emodernbuddhism.com Modern Buddhism - A free eBook about Buddhism] * [http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com Chinese Buddhist Encyclopedia]  {{Religions}}  [[Category:Buddhism| ]]</text>
