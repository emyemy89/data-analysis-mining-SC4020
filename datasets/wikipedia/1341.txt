The [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] used for chemical warfare are [[poison]]ous.   Chemical warfare has been used since the [[Stone Age]].  Since 1899, several [[international law]]s have said that using chemical weapons is [[illegal]]. But chemical weapons have still been used in wars since then.<ref name="Auto5R-1"><span class="plainlinks">[[s:Hague II (1899)#Article 23|Article 23]]</span>. wikisource.org.

Some chemical weapons are meant to kill people; they do this by poisoning them. Other chemical weapons are meant to "incapacitate" people (make them unable to fight back). They do this by causing [[pain]], injuries, or sickness.  Chemical warfare does not include using living [[organism]]s (like [[anthrax disease|anthrax bacteria]]) to make people sick. That is called [[biological warfare]].   However, some living organisms make [[toxin]]s (poisons). These toxins are not alive. For example, [[botulinum toxin]] is made by a [[bacteria]], and [[ricin]] is made by the [[castor oil plant]]. Because botulinum toxin and ricin are not alive, using them to make people sick is called chemical warfare. This is explained in the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] (CWC). The Convention also says that any toxic chemical is a chemical weapon unless it is used for legal reasons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Convention on the prohibition of the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and on their destruction (CWC): Annexes and original signatories |url=http://www.state.gov/t/avc/trty/175492.htm|publisher=Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance|accessdate=19 January 2012}}</ref>  About 70 different chemicals have been used or [[stockpile]]d (saved up) as chemical warfare agents during the [[20th century]]. The Chemical Weapons Convention says that all of these chemicals should be destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thebulletin.org/2009/06/disarmament-lessons-from-the-chemical-weapons-convention/|title=Disarmament lessons from the Chemical Weapons Convention|date=16 June 2009|publisher=}}</ref>  The Chemical Weapons Convention lists three different groups of chemicals. These are chemicals that are poisonous enough to be used as chemical weapons, or chemicals that may be used to make chemical weapons. * ''Schedule 1 Substances (Chemicals)'': These chemicals can be used for nothing but chemical weapons (or for very few other things). Because of this, they may only be made or used for [[research]]; [[medicine]]; to make [[medication]]s or [[antidote]]s; or for protective reasons (for example, to test chemical weapons sensors, which can tell when a chemical weapon is nearby, or to test protective clothing). Examples include [[Nerve agent|nerve agents]], ricin, [[lewisite]], and [[Sulfur mustard|mustard gas]]. If a country makes over 100 [[gram]]s of any of these chemicals, the country must report this to the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]] (OPCW). A country may have a stockpile of no more than one [[ton]] of these chemicals. * ''Schedule 2 Substances'': These chemicals have some specific uses other than chemical warfare, but not many. For example, [[dimethyl methylphosphonate]] can be used to make [[sarin]], a nerve agent. But it is also used as a [[flame retardant]].  Another example is [[Thiodiglycol]], which can be used to make mustard gas. But is also widely used as to make [[ink]]s. * ''Schedule 3 Substances'': These chemicals have many uses other than chemical warfare. One example is [[phosgene]].  It can be used as a chemical weapon, but it is also an important chemical used to make [[plastic]]s.  Another example is [[chloropicrin]], which has also been used as a chemical weapon, but is also used as a [[fumigation|fumigant]] (for example, to kill [[Insect|insects]] in a house). The OPCW must be told of, and may inspect, any company that makes more than 30 tons of these chemicals in a year.  ==Technology== {| style="margin:0 0 1em 1em; border:1px solid #aaa; background:#edf3fe; text-align:center; font-size:90%; margin:auto;"  cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" |+'''Chemical warfare technology timeline''' |- style="background:#ccf; border-top:1px solid #aaa;" ! style="border-right:1px solid #aaa; border-bottom:2px solid #aaa;" | ! style="border-right:1px solid #aaa; border-bottom:2px solid #aaa;" | '''''Chemical Weapons Used''''' ! style="border-right:1px solid #aaa; border-bottom:2px solid #aaa;" | '''''How Were They Used?''''' ! style="border-right:1px solid #aaa; border-bottom:2px solid #aaa;" | '''''How Did People Try to Protect Themselves?''''' ! style="border-right:1px solid #aaaaa; border-bottom:2px solid #aaa;" | '''''How Did People Recognize the Weapon?''''' |- | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| '''1914''' | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| [[Chlorine]]<br />[[Chloropicrin]]<br />[[Phosgene]]<br />[[Mustard gas]] | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| The chemicals were spread by [[wind]] | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| Gas masks<br />Gauze that had been [[urination|urinated]] on | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| Smell |- style="background:#DCDFFE" | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| '''1918''' | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| [[Lewisite]] | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| Chemical shells<br />([[projectile]]s filled with chemicals) | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| Gas mask<br />Rosin oil clothing | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| Smell of geraniums (a type of [[flower]]) |- | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| '''1920s''' | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| &nbsp; | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| Projectiles with central bursters | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| CC-2 protective clothing | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| &nbsp; |- style="background:#DCDFFE" | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| '''1930s''' | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| [[Nerve agent#Commonly known nerve agents#"G series" nerve gases|G-series nerve agents]] | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| Bombs dropped from airplanes | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| &nbsp; | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| Blister agent detectors<br />Color change paper |- | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| '''1940s''' | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| &nbsp; | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| [[Missile]]s filled with chemicals warheads<br />Spray tanks | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| Protective ointment (mustard)<br />Collective protection<br />[[Gas mask]] with Whetlerite | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| &nbsp; |- style="background:#DCDFFE" | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| '''1950s''' | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| |- | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| '''1960s''' | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| [[Nerve agent#Commonly known nerve agents#"V series" nerve gases|V-series nerve agents]] | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| Aerodynamic | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| Gas mask w/ water supply | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| Nerve gas alarm |- style="background:#DCDFFE" | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| '''1970s''' | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| |- | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| '''1980s''' | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| &nbsp; | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| Binary weapons (once fired, two chemicals<br />inside mix to make the chemical weapon) | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| Improved gas masks<br />(better protection, fit, and comfort) | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| [[Laser]] detection |- style="background:#DCDFFE" | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| '''1990s''' | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| [[Novichok agent|Novichok nerve agents]] | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| &nbsp; | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"| &nbsp; | style="border-right:1px solid #aaa;"|&nbsp; |}  == History == Although very basic chemical warfare has been used in many parts of the world for thousands of years,<ref>{{Citation|last=Syed|first=Tanya|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7837826.stm|title=Ancient Persians 'gassed Romans'|publisher=BBC|date=2009-01-19|accessdate=2009-02-21}}</ref> "modern" chemical warfare began during [[World War I]] (see the page [[Chemical weapons in World War I]]).  Since modern chemical warfare started in World War I, countries have tried to research and make chemical weapons.  They have had four main goals: # To make new, more deadly agents (types of chemical weapons) # To create ways of delivering chemical weapons that will hurt or kill even more people # To come up with better protections against chemical weapons # To create better ways of detecting chemical weapons (realizing that chemical weapons are nearby)  === Ancient history === Chemical warfare was first used during the Stone Age.  Stone Age people used poisoned [[Arrow|arrows]] and [[spear]]-tips. These were dipped in poisons, like [[venom]] from [[snake]]s or [[scorpion]]s. Sometimes they used poisonous plants.   The [[Ancient China|Ancient Chinese]] used different forms of poisonous [[Smoke|smokes]], when they [[Siege|besieged]] a city to try to take it over.  The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] used a form of burning wood, pitch from plants, and [[sulphur]].  === World War I === ''Main article: [[Chemical weapons in World War I]]'' [[File:Mustard gas ww2 poster.jpg|thumb|upright|right|{{Center|[[United States Army|U.S. Army]] poster about mustard gas}}]]  Poison gas was first used in World War I. [[France]] was the first country to make this type of gas. However, [[Germany]] was the first to use it in [[battle]], on March 15th, 1915. On that day, they used [[tear gas]] against France.  The three types of gas used in World War One were: # [[Chlorine]] gas (tear gas): Tear gas makes people [[cough]], have [[Dyspnea|trouble breathing]], and go [[Blindness|blind]] until the tear gas wears off # Phosgene gas: Phosgene caused people to cough and choke much worse than tear gas.  Phosgene gas is a very deadly chemical weapon. [[Historian|Historians]] think about 100,000 people died in World War I from chemical weapons.  They also think that 85% of these people (85,000 people) were killed by phosgene. # Mustard gas: Mustard gas was almost impossible to protect against. It caused very bad, painful sores on the outside and inside of the body. At first, very basic ways of spreading these gases were used. Even so, many [[Soldier|soldiers]] could be [[Casualty (person)|hurt or killed]]. This was partly because World War I was fought using[[trench warfare]], so many soldiers would be in the same place at the same time, and escaping from poisonous gases would be very hard.  Germany was the first country in World War I to use chemical warfare in [[battle]].<ref>{{citation  |url=http://net.lib.byu.edu/~rdh7/wwi/1915/chlorgas.html  |title=The Use of Poison Gas  |date=22 April 1915  |first=Will |last=Irwin  |journal=New York Tribune}}</ref> They simply opened containers of chlorine upwind of enemy soldiers, so that the wind would carry the chlorine gas to their enemies.   Soon after this, the French started using chemical weapons too.  They filled [[artillery]] projectiles with phosgene and fired them at the Germans. This was a much more effective way of using chemical weapons. It would become the most common way of delivering chemical weapons during World War I.<ref>{{citation  |first=Jeffrey Allan |last=Johnson  |title=The Kaiser's Chemists: Science and Modernization in Imperial Germany  |publisher=University of North Carolina Press  |year=1990}}</ref>  === Modern use === Chemical weapons were not used very much in [[World War II]], except by the [[Japan|Japanese]] army during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|invasion of China]]. This was because everybody was afraid that the other side would use weapons like theirs. Also, chemical weapons were not easy to use. They took time to use, and this made it harder for soldiers to move quickly. Also, the [[raw material]]s needed to make chemical weapons were not easy to get. This was because World War II was fought in areas which were not connected well by [[railroad]]s.  During the [[Iran-Iraq War]], [[Iraq]] used chemical weapons ([[Iran]] did not).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/dc/briefs/030701.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-08-04 |archive-date=2009-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210065525/http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/dc/briefs/030701.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> Many people believe that Iraq used chemical weapons against the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] people.  The [[United States]] has used chemical weapons even after World War II. For example, the U.S. used [[Agent Orange]] during the [[Vietnam War]].  It has been reported that many other countries, like [[People's Republic of China|the People's Republic of China]], [[Cuba]], [[Egypt]], Iran, [[Israel]], [[North Korea]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], and [[Serbia and Montenegro]], have chemical weapons.  ==Laws about chemical weapons== According to [[international law]], it is wrong to use chemical weapons. Since 1899, there have been many rules that make it illegal to [[Manufacturing|make]], [[import]], and use chemical weapons.   The first international law to make chemical warfare illegal was the [[Hague Convention]] in 1899.    After World War I, [[1925 Geneva Protocol|the Geneva Protocol of 1925]] made it illegal to use chemical or biological weapons on people.  In 1997, the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) was created.  As of the end of 2015, 192 countries had agreed to follow the CWC.  According to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, as of October 2015, 90% of the world's chemical weapons stockpiles had been destroyed.  == Chemical agents == The main types of agents used in chemical warfare are: * Nerve agents, like sarin or [[VX]] * [[Mustard gas|Mustard agents]] * [[Hydrogen cyanide]]-based agents * [[Arsin]]es, like lewisite * [[Toxin]]s, like ''Botulinum'' toxin * [[Incapacitating agent]]s (chemicals that make large numbers of people unable to fight back, but without permanently hurting or killing them).  Examples include: ** [[Tear gas]]es ** [[Pepper spray]]  If we use chemicals (like Agent Orange or [[glyphosate]]) to destroy plants, sometimes human beings may be affected by [[side-effect|side effect]]s. But, we will not call it chemical warfare. Chemical warfare covers only direct attacks on human life.  == References == {{reflist}}  [[Category:Chemical warfare| ]]</text>
