It is part of the [[Malay Archipelago|Malay Islands]]. It has 18,108 [[island|islands]]. People live on about 6,000 of these islands. The most important islands of Indonesia are [[Java]], [[Bali]], [[Borneo]], [[Sulawesi]], and [[Sumatra]]. The capital of Indonesia is [[Jakarta]], on Java. The president now is [[Joko Widodo]]. Modern Indonesia began on the 17th of August 1945. At 10 o'clock on that Friday morning, Sukarno read Indonesia's Declaration of Independence. Indonesia's Independence Day is a national holiday.  Indonesia is the fourth most populated country in the world with 238,452,952 people (2004 est.) Half of the [[population]] lives in Java, There are 111 people per km<sup>2</sup>. The land area is 1.904 million km<sup>2</sup>, or slightly smaller than [[Mexico]]. The official [[language]] of Indonesia is [[Indonesian language|Bahasa Indonesia]], but a total of 737 languages are spoken in different parts of Indonesia. Most of these many languages are only spoken among remote tribal groups. Other languages widely spoken in Indonesia include [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Balinese language|Balinese]] and [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]. Indonesia's neighbors are [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Malaysia]], and [[East Timor]] which share land borders with Indonesia. Other nearby countries are [[Australia]] to the south, [[Singapore]] to the Northwest, and [[Philippines]] to the Northeast.  Indonesia has the most [[Active volcano|active volcanoes]] of any country in the world. It is also close to [[Fault_(geology)|fault lines]] so there are many [[Earthquake|earthquakes]] and [[Tsunami|tsunamis]].  Most people in Indonesia follow [[Islam]], but Indonesia is not an Islamic country by law. Indonesia has the largest [[Muslim]] population on earth. Other religions Indonesians follow include [[Christianity]] ([[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]]), [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]].  == History == [[File:LocationIndonesia.svg|250px|thumb|left|Indonesia]] === Pre World War II === Indonesia has a written history as far back as the 7th century and a much longer [[oral history]]. Before the colonial Dutch came in the 1596, much of what is now Indonesia was many different kingdoms. Often they were fighting each other.   Indonesia was [[colonized]] by the [[Netherlands]] in the 17th century and renamed the [[Dutch East Indies]]. During this time, the Dutch captured thousands of [[Malagasy people]] from [[Madagascar]] and forced them to work on [[pepper]] [[Plantation|plantations]] in their colonies as [[Slavery|slaves]].<ref>{{cite speech  |title=Memories of Madagascar  |first=Wendy   |last=Wilson-Fall  |author-link=  |event=[[Howard University|HU]] Palaver Series  |location=[[Washington, D.C.]]  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-Pg_qGpuws  |access-date=2020-11-21 }}</ref> The Dutch treated the islands like their property until [[World War II]].   During [[World War II]], the [[Japan]]ese drove out the Dutch and took control of Indonesia. After Japan surrendered in the war, Indonesia claimed its [[independence]] on the 17th of August 1945. The proclamation was read by [[Sukarno]] in Jakarta. Sukarno later became Indonesia's first President.  British troops came into Indonesia to restore peace and to rescue Europeans who had been prisoners of the Japanese. The British troops also had the job of shipping home 300,000 Japanese troops. The Indonesian Republicans fought the British troops, because it was expected that the British would give Indonesia back to the Dutch. The Indonesian Republicans killed many of the Japanese prisoners, before they could be sent home. They also began killing people from [[Minority group|minority groups]] who might be against the new Republic. Many European and Indonesian European people were killed. Many Chinese business people and other minority groups were killed or made homeless. In Java there were many thousands of homeless people.  In 1946, the Dutch came back. When the British left in 1947, there were 55,000 Dutch soldiers in Indonesia. The Dutch action was called "Operatie Product" or "Politionele Acties". The Indonesian Republicans fought the Dutch until 1949. But the Indonesian Republicans were badly organised and often fought among themselves.  As the Dutch forced the Republican soldiers out of different areas, they moved in more troops until there were 100,000 Dutch troops. The Dutch refused to obey the [[United Nations]] who said they should stop the fighting in Indonesia. The United States of America organised for meetings between Dutch and Indonesian leaders. The Dutch finally agreed to recognise Indonesia's independence in November 1949.  Because of the fighting and the bad organisation, it took a long time for the country to become peaceful, and for the [[economy]] to get better. Many Indonesian soldiers had died, between 45,000 and 100,000. Also, a very large number of [[civilian|civilians]], Indonesians, Europeans and Chinese, had died; perhaps as many as 200,000.  ===Suharno, Sukarno, Sarwo Edhie Wibowo/Slaughter of Indonesian "Communists"=== The balance of power was shifted in favour of anti-Communists in December 1965, when personnel from both the Army Para-commando Regiment and 5th Brawijaya Military Region units arrived in Bali after having carried out killings in Java. Led by Suharto's principal troubleshooter, Sarwo Edhie Wibowo, Javanese military commanders permitted Balinese squads (led by Anwar Congo, Adi Zulkadry, Safit Pardede) to kill until reined in. <ref>Taylor (2003), p. 359; Vickers (2005), p. 158; Vittachi (1967), p. 143</ref> In contrast to Central Java where the Army encouraged people to kill the "Gestapu", Bali's eagerness to kill was so tremendous and spontaneous that, having provided logistic support initially, the Army eventually had to step in to prevent chaos.<ref name="Friend 2003, p. 113">Friend (2003), p. 113.</ref> Sukarno's choice of Bali's provincial governor, [[Anak Agung Bagus Suteja|Suteja]], was recalled from office and accused of preparing a communist uprising, and his relatives were tracked down and killed.<ref>Taylor (2003), p. 358; Robinson (1995), pp. 299302; Vittachi (1967), p. 143</ref> A series of killings similar to those in Central and East Java were led by black-shirted PNI youth. For several months, militia death squads went through villages capturing suspects and taking them away.<ref name="Vickers_158" /> Hundreds of houses belonging to communists and their relatives were burnt down within one week of the reprisal crusade, with occupants being butchered as they ran from their homes. An early estimate suggested that 50,000 people, including women and children, were killed in this operation alone. The population of several Balinese villages were halved in the last months of 1965.<ref name="Vittachi 1967, p. 143">Vittachi (1967), p. 143</ref> All the [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]] shops in the towns of [[Singaraja]] and [[Denpasar]] were destroyed and many of their owners who were alleged to have financially supported the "Gestapu" killed.<ref name="Vittachi 1967, p. 143" /> Between December 1965 and early 1966, an estimated 80,000 Balinese were killed, roughly 5% of the island's population at the time, and proportionally more than anywhere else in Indonesia.<ref>Friend (2003), p. 111; Taylor (2003), p. 358; Vickers (2005), p. 159; Robinson (1995), p. ch. 11.</ref> Most of the people killed had little to do with Communist Party or other allegations thrown at them.  Sukarno continued to command loyalty from large sections of the armed forces as well as the general population, and Suharto was careful not to be seen to be seizing power in his own coup. For eighteen months following the quashing of the 30 September Movement, there was a complicated process of political manoeuvres against Sukarno, including student agitation, stacking of parliament, media propaganda and military threats.<ref name="Vickers 2005, page 160">Vickers (2005), page 160</ref>  In January 1966, university students under the banner of [[KAMI (Indonesia)|KAMI]], begin demonstrations against the Sukarno government voicing demands for the disbandment of PKI and control of hyperinflation. The students received support and protection from the army. Street fights broke out between the students and pro-Sukarno loyalists with the pro-Suharto students prevailing due to army protection.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), pages 288 - 290</ref>  In February 1966, Sukarno promoted Suharto to lieutenant-general (and to full general in July 1966).<ref name="Elson 2001 pages = 130135">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 130135 }}</ref> The killing of a student demonstrator and Sukarno's order for the disbandment of [[KAMI (Indonesia)|KAMI]] in February 1966 further galvanised public opinion against the president. On 11 March 1966, the appearance of unidentified troops around [[Merdeka Palace]] during a cabinet meeting (which Suharto had not attended) forced Sukarno to flee to [[Bogor Palace]] (60&nbsp;km away) by helicopter. Three pro-Suharto generals, Major-General [[Basuki Rahmat]], Brigadier-General [[M Jusuf]], and Brigadier-General [[Amirmachmud]] went to Bogor to meet Sukarno. There, they persuaded and secured a presidential decree from Sukarno (see ''[[Supersemar]]'') that gave Suharto authority to take any action necessary to maintain security.<ref name="Vickers 2005, page 160" />  Using the ''Supersemar'' letter, Suharto ordered the banning of PKI the following day and proceeded to purge pro-Sukarno elements from the parliament, the government and military, accusing them of being communist sympathisers. The army arrested 15 cabinet ministers and forced Sukarno to appoint [[Second Revised Dwikora Cabinet|a new cabinet]] consisting of Suharto supporters. The army arrested pro-Sukarno and pro-communist members of the [[Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat|MPRS]] (parliament), and Suharto replaced chiefs of the navy, air force, and the police force with his supporters, who then began an extensive purge within each service.<ref name="Elson 2001 pages = 130135"/>  In June 1966, the now-purged parliament passed 24 resolutions including the banning of [[MarxismLeninism]], ratifying the [[Supersemar]], and stripping Sukarno of his title of President for Life. Against the wishes of Sukarno, the government ended the Konfrontasi with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations<ref name="Hughes 2002, pages 267-270" >{{harvnb|Hughes|2002| pages = 267270 }}</ref> (Sukarno had removed Indonesia from the UN in the previous year).<ref name="Hughes 2002, page 107" >{{harvnb|Hughes|2002| page = 107 }}</ref> Suharto did not seek Sukarno's outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining support for the president among some elements of the armed forces.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p.25</ref>  By January 1967, Suharto felt confident that he had removed all significant support for Sukarno within the armed forces, and the MPRS decided to hold another session to impeach Sukarno. On 22 February 1967, Sukarno announced he would resign from the presidency, and on 12 March, the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power and named Suharto [[Acting presidency of Suharto|acting president]].<ref>{{cite book | last =McDonald | first =Hamish | title =Suharto's Indonesia | url =https://archive.org/details/suhartoindonesia0000mcdo | publisher =Fontana Books | year =1980 | pages =[https://archive.org/details/suhartoindonesia0000mcdo/page/60 60] | isbn =0-00-635721-0}}</ref> Sukarno was placed under house arrest in [[Bogor Palace]]; little more was heard from him, and he died in near seclusion in June 1970.  ==Provinces== [[File:Indonesia, administrative divisions - en - monochrome.svg|left|450px|thumb|Provinces of Indonesia]] Indonesia has 34 provinces.
