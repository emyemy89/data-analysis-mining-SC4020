Many people think that depression just means a person is very [[sadness|sad]]. However, depression can cause many [[symptom]]s in the body as well as [[mood]] problems.  ==Diagnosis==  The [[ICD-10]] is used around the world to diagnose people with illnesses like depression. According to the ICD-10, for a person to be [[diagnosis|diagnosed]] with depression, their symptoms have to last for at least two weeks. The symptoms must happen every day, or almost every day. These symptoms also have to cause problems in a person's life (like their work life, family life, social life, or other important parts of their life).<ref name="icd">{{cite web|url=http://cloud.aapc.com/documents/Depressive-Disorder-ICD-10-BH.pdf|title=ICD-10 Resource: Coding for Major Depressive Disorder|date=2013|publisher=AAPC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821234207/http://cloud.aapc.com/documents/Depressive-Disorder-ICD-10-BH.pdf|archive-date=21 August 2014|access-date=September 14, 2016}}</ref>  Usually, for depression to be diagnosed, a person must have five or more of these symptoms:<ref name=icd/>  * Depressed mood for most of the day (feelings of sadness, emptiness, and/or hopelessness) ** [[Teenager]]s may be [[irritation|irritable]] (they may get [[anger|angry]] easily) instead of seeming depressed * Feeling much less interested than usual in all, or almost all, activities; or [[anhedonia|not getting any pleasure]] from activities * Significant [[weight loss]] (when not [[Diet (nutrition)|dieting]]) or weight gain (generally a change of 5% or more in body weight) * Sleeping [[hypersomnia|more than usual]], or [[insomnia|having trouble sleeping]] * Moving around more than usual (psychomotor agitation) or moving more slowly than usual (psychomotor retardation) * Feeling tired or not having energy, nearly every day * Feeling worthless or [[Guilt (emotion)|guilty]] * Not being able to think, concentrate, or make decisions normally * Thinking a lot about death (not just being afraid to die)  Most people who have not had depression do not completely understand its effects. Instead, they see it as simply being sad. Since it is not understood, many people criticize people with depression for not helping themselves.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}  Some people with depression die by [[suicide]]. Depression is one of the mental illnesses that can cause a person to have suicidal thoughts.  ==Prevalence== {{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}  It is impossible to get an exact [[statistics|number]] of how many people have depression. There are many reasons for this. For example:  * People may not admit to having depression, because of the stigma about depression * Some people may not be correctly diagnosed with depression * Different doctors and mental health workers may diagnose depression differently * The number of people diagnosed with depression is different in different cultures, and among men and women  ===In different cultures===  Major depression is one of the most common mental illnesses in the United States.<ref name=prev>{{cite web |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/major-depression-among-adults.shtml | title=Major Depression Among Adults| website=National Institutes of Mental Health |publisher=National Institutes of Health |access-date=September 14, 2016}}</ref> In 2014, 15.7 million adults in the United States had at least one episode of major depression. This is about 6.7% of all adults in the United States.<ref name=prev/>  Around the world, depression causes more [[disability]] than any other mental health or behavioral illness, according to the [[World Health Organization]].<ref name=prev/>  However, the [[prevalence]] of depression is different in different cultures and countries.  Prince (1968) found virtually no depression in most Asian and African countries. However, psychologists such as Zhang and Kleinman have found disorders with similar symptoms, but different names. For example, in the 1980s, Zhang found that in China, there was little mention of depression. However, instead, a disorder called Neurasthenia was far more common. When interviewing Neurasthenia patients, Zhang found that their symptoms matched the symptoms of depression by over 80%. While the term "depression" was practically unheard of in China, Neurasthenia could well have been a similar disorder  or the same thing.  It is also important to take in different cultures ways of classifying depression. For example, in China, many people believe doctors solve physical symptoms, not mental problems. This may have made it more likely for "depression" to be diagnosed as a medical condition like "Neurasthenia."  ===In men and women===  Typically, in most Western cultures, women are diagnosed with depression twice as often as men. However, men are often more likely than women to die by suicide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.samaritans.org/sites/default/files/kcfinder/branches/branch-96/files/Suicide_statistics_report_2015.pdf|title=Suicide Statistics Report 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616011122/http://www.samaritans.org/sites/default/files/kcfinder/branches/branch-96/files/Suicide_statistics_report_2015.pdf|archive-date=16 June 2015}}</ref>  == Depression in children== Depression in [[children]] can be harder to see. Children who are depressed may have a loss of [[appetite]], meaning that they do not want to eat. They may also be clearly having more trouble in everyday life than before. For example, they may have sleep problems like [[nightmare]]s; new problems with behaviour or grades at [[school]]; or be more irritable than usual.<ref>Child depression 2005, in Cambridge Encyclopedia of Child Development, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom</ref>  == Types of depression == {{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}  '''Major depressive disorder''' is also referred to as ''major, biochemical, clinical, endogenous'', or ''biological depression''. It may also be called ''unipolar affective disorder''.  There are many subtypes of depression: * ''[[Melancholia]]'', or ''melancholic depression'', is very severe (bad). It can cause many physical changes, like sleep and appetite changes. It can also cause a person to change their behavior - for example, by not wanting to be around other people. * ''[[Psychosis|Psychotic]] depression'' is much like melancholia, but with [[hallucination]]s or [[delusion]]s. * ''[[Atypical depression]]'' causes [[anxiety]] and [[panic attack]]s. * ''Chronic dysthymic disorder'' is a [[Dysthymia|long-term, mild depression]] that lasts for at least two [[year]]s. It often begins in [[adolescence]] and lasts for many years. * ''[[Seasonal affective disorder]]'' (SAD) is when the depression seems to be related to the [[winter]] season. It usually starts in the [[autumn]] and goes away in the [[spring]] every year.  It is common in [[Alaska]], [[Canada]], and [[Scandinavia]] ([[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], and [[Finland]]), but not in [[Iceland]].  == Causes of depression == As of 2016, scientists believe there is no one cause of depression. There is a lot of argument over whether depression is caused by biological, cognitive, or sociocultural factors: * ''Biological'' explanations of depression focus on changes in brain chemicals ([[neurotransmitter]]s). * ''Cognitive'' explanations of depression focus on how the way we think (cognition) affects our mood. These explanations say that if a person thinks negatively, this thinking can make them feel negatively about themselves and the world around them. * ''Sociocultural'' explanations of depression blame stressful things like [[divorce]], [[unemployment|losing a job]], [[bullying]], and [[poverty]] for causing depression.  The United States [[National Institutes of Health]] say that depression comes from the brain. However, [[scientist]]s are still trying to find out exactly why it happens.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/men-and-depression/causes-of-depression.shtml |title=NIMH  Causes of Depression  |work=nimh.nih.gov |year=2011 [last update] |access-date=July 18, 2011}}</ref>  ===Possible causes=== There are many [[theory|theories]] about what causes depression.  These theories include:{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} * '''Heredity''' (someone's [[gene]]s): Depression often runs in families. However, people can get depression even if they are not related to anyone else who has it. * '''[[Physiology]]''': The amounts of some chemicals in the brain. [[Serotonin]] is the main chemical in the brain that has to do with happiness. Many [[antidepressant]] [[medicine|medications]] work by balancing the amount of serotonin in the brain. * '''[[Psychology|Psychological]] factors''': Low [[self-esteem]] and harmful thinking * '''Early experiences''': Events such as the death of a parent or guardian, [[abandonment]] or rejection, [[neglect]], [[Chronic|chronic illness]], and severe [[Physical abuse|physical]], [[Psychological abuse|psychological]], or [[sexual abuse]]. * '''Life experiences''': Losing a job, [[homelessness]], problems with money, death of a loved one, relationship problems, separation from a partner, being a victim of crime, or other life problems can cause depression. * '''Medical conditions''': Some illnesses, such as [[hypothyroidism]], [[hepatitis]], [[mononucleosis]], or [[traumatic brain injury|head injuries]], may contribute to depression. * '''[[Alcoholic drink|Alcohol]] and other drugs''': Alcohol can make people depressed. If a person abuses alcohol, [[benzodiazepine]]-based tranquillizers, sleeping medications, or [[narcotics]], it can affect how long their depression lasts and how bad it is. Some medicines like [[Oral contraceptive|birth control pills]] and [[steroid]]s may also contribute to depression. * '''[[Pesticide]]s''': Several [[Clinical trial|scientific studies]] <ref>Psychiatric disorders among Egyptian pesticide applicators and formulators.By Amr MM, Halim ZS, Moussa SS.

Some depressed people also have other mental disorders, such as [[personality disorder]]s and [[anxiety disorder]]s.  == Treatment == Depression is usually treated with a combination of medication and other therapy. Good exercise helps deal with depression, since exercise releases chemicals that put a person in a better mood.<ref>Dunn, A., Exercise for Depression Rivals Drugs, Therapy. American Journal of Preventive Medicine, January 2005; vol 28: pp 1-8. National Institutes for Mental Health, "Depression." News release, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.</ref> Having a supportive group of friends and doing outside activities can also help prevent or ease depression.  === Medication ===  There are many [[medication]]s that can help with depression. Many of these are called [[antidepressant]]s. Examples of medications used to treat depression include:<ref name=meds>{{cite web |title=Antidepressants: Selecting One That's Right for You |website=Mayo Clinic Online |publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |date=2016 |access-date=September 15, 2016}}</ref>  *''[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s'' (SSRIs). These are now the most commonly used type of antidepressant medicine. These drugs work by allowing the brain to have more [[serotonin]]. They have fewer [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effects]] than older antidepressants. Examples include [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac), [[paroxetine]] (Paxil), and [[sertraline]] (Zoloft). *''[[Tricyclic antidepressant]]s''. These are an older type of antidepressant. They are not used often today because they have many bad side effects and do not work as well as SSRIs.  An example is nortriptyline (Allegron). *''[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s'' (MAOIs). They may be used if other antidepressant medications do not work well. This kind of medicine cannot be taken with many different foods and other medications.  Sometimes, antidepressant medicine works better when it is used together with another drug that is not an antidepressant. These "augmentor" drugs include:<ref name=meds/>  *''[[Tranquillizer]]s and [[sedative]]s''. These can help people sleep better and feel less [[anxiety|anxious]]. *''[[Antipsychotic]]s''. These can help keep stop [[mood swings]]. They can also make hallucinations better, or make them go away completely. *''[[Lithium]]''. This is a [[mood stabilizer]] often used for [[bipolar disorder]], but it can also help people with depression.  If people with depression do not take their medicine the right way, the depression can get worse. A doctor must help when they want to change to another medication, or to take a different amount of a medication than before.  === Psychotherapy === [[Psychotherapy]] is often a helpful treatment for depression.<ref name=apa>{{cite web| url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/understanding-depression.aspx |title=Understanding Depression and Effective Treatment |publisher=American Psychological Association |date=July 2010 |access-date=September 15, 2016}}</ref> In [[psychotherapy]], a therapist helps a person to understand and solve problems which cause depression. The therapist also helps the person learn skills for dealing with their depression. <ref name=apa/>  Psychotherapy can help a person make changes in the way they think, in order to help with life problems and understand what makes depression worse.<ref name=apa/> The most effective psychotherapy for depression is [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT).{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} This teaches a person to think in a more rational, positive, realistic manner.  === Surgeries and procedures === [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT), also called [[electroshock therapy]] or [[shock therapy]], is used to treat a small percentage of severely depressed people. ECT uses a small amount of [[electricity]] to cause an [[epileptic seizure]] while the patient is under [[anesthesia]]. This may cause some memory loss ([[amnesia]]) or other side effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/electroconvulsive-therapy/basics/definition/prc-20014161 |title=Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) |date=September 19, 2015 |website=Mayo Clinic Online |publisher=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research |access-date=September 15, 2016}}</ref>  In the past, [[physician|doctors]] used different ways of treating depression. These are rarely used any more. They include: * [[Insulin]] shock treatment. The doctor would lower a patient's [[blood sugar]] so much that the patient would have a [[seizure]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/nash/filmmore/ps_ict.html|title=American Experience: A Brilliant Madness|website=WGBH|publisher=[[PBS]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021015015145/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/nash/filmmore/ps_ict.html|archive-date=15 October 2002|access-date=September 15, 2016}}</ref> * [[Lobotomy]].
