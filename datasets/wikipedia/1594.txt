''Numbers: their history and meaning''. Courier Dover. {{ISBN|0-486-42165-1}}</ref> It is a positional notation system. This system has ten basic [[symbol]]s, they are [[0 (number)|0]], [[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[6 (number)|6]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[8 (number)|8]] and [[9 (number)|9]]. It represent numbers in the decimal number system. The HinduArabic numeral system was first developed by the [[Hindu]]s. Later, It was introduced to the western world by the [[Arab]]s. The HinduArabic numeral system is one of the few [[numeral system]]s that use a [[place value]] system. This system is now commonly used all over the world.  They originated in India in the 6th or 7th century and were introduced to Europe through the writings of Middle Eastern mathematicians, especially [[al-Khwarizmi]] and [[al-Kindi]], about the 12th century.  They are very different from previous methods of counting, such as the [[abacus]], and paved the way for the development of algebra.  In the past many other systems were used.<ref>Menninger, Karl 1969. ''Number words and number symbols: a cultural history of numbers''.
