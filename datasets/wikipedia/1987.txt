He is famous for his work on the theory of [[evolution]].  His book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859) did two things. First, it provided a great deal of [[evidence]] that evolution has taken place. Second, it proposed a [[theory]] to explain ''how'' evolution works. That theory is [[natural selection]].<ref>Darwin, Charles (annotated by James T. Costa). 2009. ''The annotated Origin: a facsimile of the first edition of On the Origin of Species''.

Cape, London. {{ISBN|1-84413-314-1}}</ref> He was the guest naturalist, which meant that he was responsible for making collections and notes about the animals, plants, and the [[geology]] of the countries they visited. The ship's crew made charts of all the coastal areas, which could be used by the navy wherever it went in the world. At the time, Britain had by far the largest navy in the world, and an [[British Empire|empire]] which was global.  Darwin collected everywhere the ship landed. He found huge [[fossil]]s of recently extinct [[mammals]], experienced an [[earthquake]] in [[Chile]], and noticed the land had been raised. He knew of raised beaches elsewhere, high in the [[Andes]], with fossil seashells and trees which had once grown on a sandy beach. Obviously the earth was constantly changing, with land rising in some places, and sinking in others. He collected birds and insects, and sent shipments back to [[Cambridge]] for experts to identify.  Darwin was the first dedicated naturalist to visit the [[Galapagos Islands]], off the west coast of [[Ecuador]]. He noticed that some of the birds were like [[mockingbird]]s on the mainland, but different enough to be placed in separate [[species]]. He began to wonder how so many new species came to be on these islands.  When Darwin got back to England, he edited a series of scientific reviews of the voyage, and wrote a personal journal which we know as ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]''. It is one of the great natural history travel diaries.<ref>Browne, Janet 1995. ''Charles Darwin: vol. 1 Voyaging''. Cape, London. {{ISBN|1-84413-314-1}}</ref>  In 1843 Darwin, who already had two children with his wife Emma, bought Down House in the [[village]] of [[Downe]], [[Kent]]. He lived there for the rest of his life, and today the house and contents are open to the public.  == Evolution == While on the H.M.S. ''Beagle'', and later back home in [[London]], Darwin had come across the ideas of the Rev. T.R. [[Malthus]]. Malthus had realised that, although humans could double their population every 25 years, it did not happen in practice. He thought the reason was that a [[struggle for existence]] (or [[resource]]s) limited their numbers. If numbers increased, then famine, wars and diseases caused more deaths. Darwin, who knew that all living things could, in principle, increase their numbers, began to think about why some survived, while others did not.<ref>Desmond A. & Moore J. ''Darwin''. 1991. Joseph, London.</ref><sup>p264-268</sup> His answer took years to develop.  The theory of evolution says that all living things on Earth, including plants, animals and microbes, come from a common [[ancestor]] by slowly changing throughout the generations. Darwin suggested that the way living things changed over time is through ''natural selection''. This is the better survival and reproduction of those that best fit their [[environment]]. Fitting into the place where you live is called [[adaptation|adapting]]. Those who fit best into the place where they live, the best adapted, have the best chance to survive and breed. Those who are less well-adapted tend not to survive. If they do not survive well enough to raise young, this means they do not pass on their [[gene]]s. In this way, the species gradually changes.  The first chapter of the ''Origin'' deals with [[domestication|domesticated animals]], such as cattle and dogs. Darwin reminded readers of the huge changes mankind had made in its domestic animals, which were once wild species. The changes were brought about by ''[[selective breeding]]''  choosing animals with desirable characters to breed from. This had been done generation after generation, until our modern breeds were produced. Perhaps what man had done deliberately, might happen in nature, where some would leave more offspring than others.  Darwin noticed that although young plants or animals are very similar to their parents, no two are exactly the same and there is always a range of shape, size, colour, and so on. Some of these differences the plant or animal may have got from their own ancestors, but some are new and caused by [[mutation]]s. When such differences made an organism more able to live in the wild, it would have a better chance to survive, and would pass on its [[genes]] to its offspring, and they to their offspring. Any difference that would cause the plant or animal to have less of a chance to live would be less likely to be passed on, and would eventually die out altogether. In this way groups of similar plants or animals (called [[species]]) slowly change in shape and form so that they can live more successfully and have more offspring who will survive them. So, natural selection had similarities to selective breeding, except that it would happen by itself, over a much longer time.  He first started thinking about this in 1838, but it took a full twenty years before his ideas became public. By 1844 he was able to write a draft of the main ideas in his notebook. [[Historian]]s think that he did not talk about his theory because he was afraid of public criticism.<ref>Bowler, Peter J. 2009. ''Evolution: the history of an idea''. 4th ed, University of California Press.</ref> He knew his theory, which did not discuss religion, raised questions about the literal truth of the [[Book of Genesis]]. Whatever the reason, he did not publish his theory in a book until 1859.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100542500 |title=Darwin's theory: too big to publish : NPR |first=Joe |last=Palca |work=npr.org |date= 2009 }}</ref> In 1858 he heard that another biologist, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], had the same ideas about natural selection. Darwin and Wallace's ideas were first published in the ''Journal of the Linnaean Society'' in London, 1858. Then, Darwin published his book the next year. The name of the book was ''[[On the Origin of Species]] by means of Natural Selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life''. This is usually called ''The Origin of Species''.<ref>Browne, Janet 2002. ''Charles Darwin: vol. 2 The power of place''.
