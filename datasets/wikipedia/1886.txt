<title>Carbon</title><text>{{Infobox carbon}} '''Carbon''' is a very important [[chemical element]], with a [[chemical symbol]] of '''C'''. All known [[life]] on [[Earth]] needs it. Carbon has [[atomic mass]] 12 and [[atomic number]] 6.  It is a [[nonmetal]], meaning that it is not a [[metal]].  When [[iron]] is [[alloy]]<nowiki/>ed with carbon, hard [[steel]] is formed. Carbon in the form of [[coal]] is an important [[fuel]].  == Chemistry of carbon == A whole type of Chemistry, [[organic chemistry]], is about carbon and its [[chemical compound|compounds]].  Carbon makes many types of compounds.  ''Hydrocarbons'' are molecules with carbon and hydrogen.  [[Methane]], [[Propane]], and many other [[fuel]]s are hydrocarbons.  Many of the substances that people use daily are organic compounds.  Carbon, [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and some other elements like [[sulfur]] and [[phosphorus]] together form most life on [[earth]] (see [[List of biologically important elements]]).  Carbon forms a very large number of [[organic compound]]s because it can form strong [[Chemical bond|bonds]] with itself and with other elements.  Because of the amounts of carbon living things have, all organic things are considered "carbon-based".  Each carbon atom can form four single [[covalent bond]]s.  These bonds allow carbon to form long chain-shaped [[molecule]]s, called [[polymer]]s, such as [[plastic]]s.  == Etymology == The name of carbon comes from [[Latin]] ''carbo'', meaning [[charcoal]]. In many foreign languages the words for carbon, [[coal]] and charcoal are synonyms.  == Types of carbon == {{main|Allotropes of carbon}} Carbon in [[nature]] is found in three forms called [[allotrope]]s: [[diamond]], [[graphite]], and [[fullerenes]]. Graphite, with [[clay]], is in [[pencil]]s. It is very soft. The carbon atoms in it make rings, which are on top of each other and slide very easily. Diamonds are the hardest natural [[mineral]]. Fullerenes are a "[[soccer]] ball" shape of carbon. They are mostly of interest to [[science]]. A special, man-made, tube-shaped allotrope of carbon is the [[carbon nanotube]]. Carbon nanotubes are very hard, so they might be used in [[armor]]. Nanotubes might be useful in [[nanotechnology]].   There are 10 million known carbon [[chemical compound|compounds]].  [[File:Eight Allotropes of Carbon.png|thumb|350px|right|Some forms of carbon: a) [[diamond]]; b) [[graphite]]; c) [[lonsdaleite]]; d-f) [[fullerene]]s (C60, C540, C70); g) [[amorphous carbon]]; h) [[carbon nanotube]].]]   == Radiocarbon dating == {{main|Radiocarbon dating}} A [[radioactive]] [[isotope]] of carbon, carbon-14, can be used to figure out how old some objects are or when something died. As long as something is on the surface of the earth and taking in carbon, the amount of carbon-14 stays the same. When an object stops taking in carbon, the carbon-14 amount goes down. Because the ''[[Half-life (element)|half-life]]'' (how long it takes for half of a radioactive isotope to go away) of carbon-14 is 5730 years,<ref name="NaturesBB">{{cite book|author=Emsley, John|year=2001|title=Nature's Building blocks|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-850341-5}}</ref> [[scientist]]s can see how old the object is by how much carbon-14 is left.  == Where carbon is ==  Carbon is in many places in the universe. It was first made in old [[star]]s. Carbon is the fourth most common element in the [[sun]].<ref name="NaturesBB"/> The [[atmosphere]]s of [[Venus]] and [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] are mostly [[carbon dioxide]].<ref name="Webelements">{{cite web|author=University of Sheffield and Webelements Ltd.|year=2007|title=Chemistry : Periodic Table : carbon : key information|url=http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/C/key.html}}</ref>  Carbon is important to the [[human body]] and other [[living thing]]s, and it is the second most common element in the human body, at 23% of all body weight.<ref name="NaturesBB"/> It is also a key part of many biological molecules ([[molecules]] used in life).  Most of the carbon on Earth is [[coal]]. [[Graphite]] is in many (typically [[desert]]) areas, including [[Sri Lanka]], [[Madagascar]], and [[Russia]]. Diamonds are rare and are found largely in [[Africa]]. Carbon is also in some meteorites.  ==Related pages== * [[List of common elements]] * [[Carbon cycle]]  == References == {{reflist}}  == Other websites == * [http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/C/key.html  Carbon at Webelements]  {{Periodic Table}} {{authority control}} [[Category:Carbon]]</text>
