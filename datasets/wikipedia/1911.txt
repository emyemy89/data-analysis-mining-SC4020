<title>Soap opera</title><text>{{unreferenced|date=July 2011}} A '''soap opera''' is a [[television]] or [[radio]] program that [[broadcast|airs]] in [[episode|episodic]] series. This means that each episode continues telling a story, which, in turn, tells more of the last episode's story. A single story on a soap opera can be told for weeks, months, or sometimes even years.  In [[United States|America]], each soap opera airs every day, Monday through Friday, in the afternoon. Because they air at this time, they are sometimes called '''daytime serials'''. In the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] and other countries, the soap operas air in the evening, twice or three times a week.  This is a list of soap operas that air in America, in their current order of popularity:  #''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' #''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' #''[[General Hospital]]'' #''[[Supernatural (TV series)|Supernatural]]'' #''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' #''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' #''[[All My Children]]'' #''[[As the World Turns]]'' #''[[One Life to Live]]'' #''[[Guiding Light]]'' #''[[Passions]]''  There are still two soaps that air in [[Australia]], [[Network Ten]]'s ''[[Neighbours]]'' and the [[Seven Network]]'s ''[[Home and Away]]''. Strangely, ''Neighbours'' is more popular in England than it is in Australia.  In the U.K., the most popular soap operas are ''[[Coronation Street]]'' and ''[[EastEnders]]''. ''Coronation Street'' is about people who live in [[Manchester]], in the northern part of England. ''EastEnders'' is about people who live in an imaginary place called Albert Square in the [[East End]] of [[London]]. Another popular soap opera is ''[[Emmerdale]]'', and it is about people who live in a small village in [[Yorkshire]], also in the northern part of England. In the 1970s ''[[Crossroads (British TV series)|Crossroads]]'' became the most watched soap in England. It was shown from 1964 to 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/540415/index.html |title=Crossroads (1964-88, 2001-03) |website=screenonline.org.uk |access-date=21 January 2020}}</ref>  In [[Latin America]] (including [[Brazil]]) and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-speaking countries in [[Africa]] (like [[Angola]]), soap operas are called ''[[telenovela]]s''.  ==Related pages== *[[Dorama]]  *[[Serial (radio and television)|Serial]] *[[Radio drama]] *[[Playwright]] *[[Theatre]]  == References == {{reflist}}  [[Category:Soap operas| ]] [[Category:Television genres]]</text>
