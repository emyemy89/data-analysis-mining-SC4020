''[[Saturnalia (dinosaur)|Saturnalia]]'', 232225&nbsp;mya, may be a basal saurischian or a [[prosauropod]]. The others are basal saurischians.  Among the earliest [[ornithischia]]n ('bird-hipped') dinosaurs is ''[[Pisanosaurus]]'' 230220&nbsp;mya. Although ''[[Lesothosaurus]]'' comes from 199189&nbsp;mya, skeletal features suggest that it branched from the main Ornithischia line at least as early as ''Pisanosaurus''.  Early saurischians were similar to early ornithischians, but different from modern [[crocodile]]<nowiki/>s. Saurischians differ from ornithischians by keeping the ancestral configuration of bones in the [[pelvis]] (shown in a diagram above). Another difference is in the skull: the upper skull of the Ornithischia is more solid, and the joint connecting the lower jaw is more flexible. These features are adaptations to [[herbivory]]; in other words, it helped them grind vegetable food.  ==Adaptive radiation== Dinosaurs were a varied group of animals. [[Adaptive radiation]] let them live in many [[ecological niche]]s.

The largest dinosaurs were [[herbivore]]s (plant-eaters), such as ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' and ''[[Brachiosaurus]]''. They were the largest [[animal]]s to ever walk on dry land. Other plant-eaters such as [[Iguanodon]] had special weapons, to help them fight off the meat-eaters. For example, ''[[Triceratops]]'' had three horns on its head shield, ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'' was covered in boney plates, and ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' had spikes on its tail.  The carnivores were [[bipedal]] (walked on their back legs), though not as we do. Their body was more towards the [[horizontal]], [[balance]]d at the back by their [[tail]]. Some were very large, like ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', but some were small, like ''[[Compsognathus]]''. It was the smaller sized meat-eaters that may have [[evolution|evolved]] into birds. The first [[fossil]] bird, ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', had a [[skeleton]] which looked much like that of a dinosaur.  ==Life style==  ===Locomotion=== Dinosaurs were primitively ''[[bipedal]]'': their probable ancestors were small bipedal Archosaurs.

Citadel N.Y.</ref> The question of whether all theropods or even all dinosaurs were warm blooded is still undecided.  It is now certain (from fossils discovered in [[China]]: see [[Jehol biota]]) that small theropods had [[feather]]s. This fits well with the idea that they were warm-blooded, and that the [[origin of birds]] can be traced to a line of small theropods.  ===Activity=== Warm blooded animals have a high metabolic rate (use up food faster). They can be more active, and for longer, than animals who depend on the [[environment]] for heating. Therefore, the idea of warm-blooded dinosaurs insulated by feathers led to the idea that they were more active, intelligent and faster runners than previously thought.<ref name=Bob/>  Main-stream palaeontologists have followed this view for small theropods, but not for larger herbivores.<ref>Benton M.J 2000.
