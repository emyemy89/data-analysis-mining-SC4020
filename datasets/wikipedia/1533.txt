<title>Solid</title><text>[[File:Solid.png|thumb|right|200px|A diagram of how molecules are arranged in a solid.]] '''Solid''' is one of the three common [[states of matter]]. The [[molecules]] in solids are closely bound together, they can only vibrate. This means solids have a definite shape that only changes when a [[Force (physics)|force]] is applied. This is different to [[liquid]]s and [[gas]]es which move randomly, a process called [[Flux|flow]].   When a solid becomes a [[liquid]], this is called [[melt]]ing. [[Liquids]] become solid by [[freezing]]. Some solids, like [[dry ice]], can turn into gas without turning liquid first. This is called [[sublimation]].  == Kinds of solids == The [[Force (physics)|forces]] between the [[atom]]s in a solid can take many forms. For example, a [[crystal]] of [[sodium chloride]] (common [[salt]]) is made up of [[ion]]ic [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]], which are held together by [[ionic bond]]s. In [[diamond]] or [[silicon]], the atoms share [[electron]]s and make [[covalent bond]]s. In [[metal]]s, electrons are shared in [[metallic bond]]ing. Some solids, like most [[Organic chemistry|organic]] compounds, are held together with "van der Waals forces" coming from the [[polarization]] of the electronic charge [[cloud]] on each [[molecule]]. The dissimilarities between the types of solid come from the differences between their bonding.  === Metals === [[File:Chrysler Building detail.jpg|thumb|right|The pinnacle of [[New York]]'s [[Chrysler Building]], the world's tallest [[steel]]-supported [[brick]] [[building]].]]  Most metals are strong, dense, and good [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] of [[electricity]] and [[Heat conduction|heat]]. The [[mass]] of the [[Chemical element|elements]] in the [[periodic table]], those to the left of a diagonal line drawn from [[boron]] to [[polonium]], are metals. Mixtures of two or more elements in which the big component is a metal are known as [[alloy]]s.  People have been using metals for many purposes since [[prehistoric]] times. The strength and relialbility of metals has led to their widespread use in making of buildings and other things, as well as in most [[vehicle]]s, many [[tool]]s, [[pipe]]s, [[road]] [[sign]]s and [[railroad track]]s. [[Iron]] and [[aluminium]] are the two most commonly used metals. They are also the most common metals in the [[Earth's crust]]. Iron is most commonly used in the form of an alloy, [[steel]], which has up to 2.1% [[carbon]], making it much harder than pure iron.  Since metals are good conductors of electricity, they are [[wikt:valuable|valuable]] in [[electrical]] tools and for carrying an electric [[Electric current|current]] over long [[distance]]s with little [[energy]] loss. Because of this, electrical power grids rely on metal [[cable]]s to get electricity. Home electrical [[system]]s, for example, are [[wire]]d with [[copper]] for its good conducting uses. The high [[thermal conductivity]] of most metals also makes them useful for stovetop cooking [[utensil]]s.  === Minerals === [[File:Different minerals.jpg|thumb|right|A collection of different [[mineral]]s.]]  [[Mineral]]s are natural solids formed through many [[Geology|geological]] processes under high [[pressure]]s. To be thought as a true mineral, a substance must have a [[crystal]] structure with uniform [[Matter|physical]] things throughout. Minerals differ in composition from pure [[elements]] and simple [[salt]]s to very complex [[silicate]]s with [[thousand]]s of known forms. In [[wikt:contrast|contrast]], a [[Rock (geology)|rock]] sample is a random [[wikt:aggregate|aggregate]] of minerals and/or mineraloids, and has no specific [[chemical]] composition. Most of the rocks of the [[Earth's crust]] have [[quartz]] (crystalline SiO<sub>2</sub>), feldspar, mica, chlorite, kaolin, calcite, epidote, [[olivine]], [[augite]], hornblende, magnetite, [[hematite]], [[limonite]] and a few other minerals. Some minerals, like [[quartz]], mica or [[feldspar]] are common, while others have been found in only a few places in the [[world]]. The largest group of minerals by far is the [[Silicate minerals|silicates]] (most rocks are 95% silicates), which are made largely of [[silicon]] and [[oxygen]], also with ions of [[aluminium]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[calcium]] and other metals.  ==Related pages== *[[Liquid]] *[[Gas]] *[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]]  == Other websites == *{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/state.html|title=Phases of Matter|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2011-05-04}}  {{Continuum mechanics}} {{States of matter}}  [[Category:Basic English 850 words]] [[Category:States of matter]]</text>
