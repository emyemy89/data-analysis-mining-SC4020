<title>Ranch</title><text>[[File:CattleDrive ColoradoUSA.jpg|thumb|Cattle drive in [[Colorado]], USA]]  A '''ranch''' is a large [[farm]] for raising [[cow]]s, [[horse]]s, [[sheep]] or other [[livestock]]. The word ''ranch'' is from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word "rancho". It is used in [[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]].  A ranch may be on private or public [[land]]. The [[desert]] areas of the western [[United States]] have many ranches, because there is much land that is not very good for [[crop]]<nowiki/>s. There are also many in desert areas of [[Australia]], where they are called [[Station (agriculture)|stations]]. Someone who takes care of the livestock may be called a [[stockman]] or [[cowboy]].   {{stub}}  [[category:Farms|*]]</text>
