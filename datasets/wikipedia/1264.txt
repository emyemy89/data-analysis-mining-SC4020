<title>Desktop environment</title><text>{{No sources|date=August 2019}}  In [[graphical user interfaces and consoles]] a '''desktop environment''' is a location on a [[personal computer]] that helps the user get around on the computer.  The desktop itself is a place in the [[operating system]] used for short cuts to [[computer file]]s and [[folder (computing)|folders]] on the hard drive. [[Computer icon]]s (small pictures) are used to represent files/folders. Clicking  these icons will open or start a folder or program. The desktop is the area where the [[start menu]] is if the computer has a start menu.  Usually the desktop is the main screen on the computer. If no programs or folders are open, the computer will display the desktop.  The most common desktop environment on personal computers is the one given by [[Microsoft Windows]]; another common environment is the one given by [[Apple]] [[Mac OS]] X. Other mostly-used desktop environments for [[UNIX|Unix]]-like [[Operating system|operating systems]] using the [[X Window System]] are [[KDE]], [[GNOME]], [[Xfce]].
