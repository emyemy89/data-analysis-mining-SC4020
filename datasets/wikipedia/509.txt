It is a [[constitutional monarchy]] that is made up of [[Countries of the United Kingdom|four separate countries]]: [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. It is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], [[NATO]] and the [[G8]]. It had the sixth largest economy in the world by [[nominal GDP]] in 2019.  Around 66 million people live in the UK (2018).<ref>Population estimates  Office for National Statistics U.K. www.ons.gov.uk. [https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates]</ref> They can be divided into four big [[nationality|nationalities]] based on the countries where they live (or where they were born or their [[ancestry]]). * [[England]] is the biggest country, where most people in the UK live. People who live in England are called [[English people|English]]. Their native [[language]] is called [[English language|English]], which is spoken by most people in England.  * [[Scotland]], north of England, is the second biggest country. People who live here are called [[Scottish people|Scottish]], and a Scottish person may be called a Scot. Some speak a language other than English: [[Scottish Gaelic]], a [[Celtic language]]. [[Scots]], on the other hand, is a version of English.  * [[Wales]] is to the west of England. Its people are called [[Welsh people|Welsh]] and they have their own Celtic language which is also called [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. Not everyone in Wales can speak Welsh, but almost everyone can speak English. * [[Northern Ireland]] is the smallest country. Unlike the other three countries, it is not on the island of [[Great Britain]]: it is part of the island called [[Ireland]]. Northern Ireland takes up about a sixth of Ireland (with the [[Republic of Ireland]] taking up the remainder). People who live in Northern Ireland are either Irish, British, or Northern Irish.  The people who live there usually speak English.  About 95 per cent of the UK's population are English speakers.<ref name="BBC languages">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/countries/uk.shtml |title=Languages across Europe: United Kingdom |publisher=BBC |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref> 5.5 per cent of the population speak languages brought to the UK as a result of relatively recent immigration.<ref name="BBC languages"/>  The UK has many [[city|cities]]. [[London]] is the biggest city in the UK and is the nation's [[capital city]]. There are also other big cities in England including [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Leeds]], [[Bristol]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Scotland has the big cities of [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]]. [[Cardiff]] and [[Swansea]] are in Wales and [[Belfast]] is in Northern Ireland.   Between the 17th and mid 20th-centuries, Britain was a world power. It became a [[British Empire|colonial empire]] that controlled large areas of [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[North America]] and [[Oceania]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/|title=BBC - History: British History in-depth|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> At its height in 1922, more than 458 million people lived in the British Empire, one-fifth of the Earth's population. Its area was 13,012,000 square miles: almost a quarter of the Earth's land area. The empire was sometimes called 'the empire on which the sun never sets', meaning the sun is always shining on at least one of its territories. Almost all countries left and became independent from the empire in the 20th century, although Britain keeps [[Commonwealth of Nations|links with most countries of its former empire]].  ==Prehistory== [[File:Stonehenge2007 07 30.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|[[Stonehenge]] in the United Kingdom]]  Species of humans have occupied Britain, off and on, for almost a million years. The occupation was not continuous, no doubt because the [[climate]] at times was too extreme. The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] conquest of Britain in 43<small>AD</small> is regarded as the start of recorded history.   [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] remains show that the first group of modern people to live in the British Isles were hunter-gatherers after the last [[ice age]] ended.<ref>By 'modern people' is meant our own species. Earlier species of man had lived in this area.</ref> The date is not known: perhaps as early as 8000<small>BC</small> but certainly by 5000<small>BC</small>. They built [[mesolithic]] wood and stone [[monument]]s. [[Stonehenge]] was built between 3000 and 1600<small>BC</small>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/stonehenge/world-heritage-sites/|title=Stonehenge and Avebury: A World Heritage Site|author=English Heritage|accessdate=21 June 2011}}</ref> [[Celt]]ic tribes arrived from mainland Europe. Britain was a changing collection of tribal areas, with no overall leader. Julius Caesar tried to invade (take over) the island in 55<small>BC</small> but was not able to do so. The Romans successfully invaded in 43<small>AD</small>.<ref>Branigan, Keith, 1980, ''Roman Britain: Life in an Imperial Province'', Readers Digest, pp12-16</ref>  ==History== {{see also|History of the United Kingdom}} Written history began in Britain when writing was brought to Britain by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. Rome ruled in Britain from 44<small>AD</small> to 410<small>AD</small>, but they only ruled England and Wales. The Romans never ruled Scotland north of the Clyde-Forth valley, or Ireland; their northern boundary varied from time to time, and was marked for a while at [[Hadrian's Wall]].  After the Romans, two waves of [[immigration|immigrants]] came to Britain. The first were [[Germanic peoples|German]] tribes: the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]]. [[English language|English]], the language, is a development from [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Old English]], and is a Germanic language. The second were the [[Viking]]s.  ===Britain unified=== [[File:United Kingdom labelled map7 vector.svg|thumb|197x197px|The [[countries of the United Kingdom]]|left]]After a long period when [[England]] was split into various kingdoms, it was made into one country by thelstan ([[Athelstan]]) in 945<small>AD</small>. England and Wales were unified by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (Longshanks) by force in the 13th century.  Union with Scotland took much longer; there were hundreds of years of conflicts between both parts of Britain. This union between England and Scotland in 1707 formed the United Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged Scotland and England into one country.  In 1603, when [[Queen]] [[Elizabeth I of England]] died, her closest relative was [[King]] [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]]. He became king of England as well as king of Scotland. In 1707, the Scottish and English Parliaments agreed the Treaty of Union, which joined the two countries into one country called ''The Kingdom of Great Britain'' under Queen [[Anne of Great Britain|Anne]].  By 1800, both Scotland and England had already independently had much influence over [[Ireland]] since 1200. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain and Ireland to merge the two states. The new country was called the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland''. In 1922 much of Ireland became independent as the [[Irish Free State]] (now called [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties (called [[Northern Ireland]]) continue to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed ''The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''.  ==Geography== [[File:Glenridding, Cumbria, England - June 2009.jpg|thumb|296x296px|Glenridding, Cumbria, England ]] The UK is made up of four different countries: [[Wales]], [[England]] and [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>Oxford English Dictionary: "British Isles: a geographical term for the islands comprising Great Britain and Ireland with all their offshore islands including the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands".</ref><ref name="page823">{{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page823 |title=Countries within a country |date=10 January 2003 |publisher=Prime Minister's Office |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080909013512/http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page823 |archive-date=9 September 2008 |url-status=dead |access-date=8 March 2015}}</ref> The capital city of Wales is [[Cardiff]]. The capital city of England is [[London]]. The capital city of Scotland is [[Edinburgh]] and the capital city of Northern Ireland is [[Belfast]]. Other large cities in the UK are [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool, Mersyside|Liverpool]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Leeds]], [[Sheffield]], [[Glasgow]], [[Southampton]], [[Leicester]], [[Coventry]], [[City of Bradford|Bradford]] and [[Nottingham]].  The UK is north-west off the coast of mainland [[Europe]]. Around the UK are the [[North Sea]], the [[English Channel]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The UK also rules, usually indirectly, a number of smaller places (mostly islands) round the world, which are known as ''overseas territories''. They are remnants of the [[British Empire]].  The physical geography of the UK varies greatly. [[England]] consists of mostly lowland terrain, with upland or mountainous terrain only found north-west of the Tees-Exe line. The upland areas include the Lake District, the Pennines, North York Moors, Exmoor and Dartmoor. The lowland areas are typically traversed by ranges of low hills, frequently composed of chalk, and flat plains. Scotland is the most mountainous country in the UK and its physical geography is distinguished by the Highland Boundary Fault which traverses the Scottish mainland from Helensburgh to Stonehaven. The Royal Observatory is the is the defining point of the Prime Meridian.   The United Kingdom is reducing [[Climate change|greenhouse gas emissions]]. It has met Kyoto Protocol target of a 12.5% reduction from 1990 levels and intends to meet the legally binding target of a 20% cut in emissions by 2010.     The [[weather]] of the United Kingdom is changeable and unpredictable. Summers are moderately warm, winters are cool to cold. Rain falls throughout the year, and more on the west than the east because of its northerly latitude and the warm water from the [[Atlantic Ocean]]'s [[Gulf Stream]]. The usually moderate prevailing winds from the Atlantic may be interrupted by [[Arctic]] air from the north-east or hot air from the [[Sahara]].  ==Politics== [[File:Palace of Westminster Westminster Hall south.jpg|thumb|257x257px|The [[Palace of Westminster]] in [[London]] is the oldest part of the buildings of [[Parliament]]]]  The United Kingdom is a [[parliament]]ary [[democracy]] based on a [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional]] [[hereditary monarchy|monarchy]]. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a [[Member of Parliament|members of Parliament]] to speak for them and to make laws for them. Queen [[Elizabeth II]] is the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and is the [[head of state]].  The [[government]], led by the [[Prime Minister]], governs the country and appoints cabinet ministers. Today, the Prime Minister is [[Boris Johnson]], who is the leader of the centre-right Conservative Party.  [[Parliament]] is where laws are made. It has three parts: the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the [[House of Lords]], and the Queen. The House of Commons is the most powerful part. It is where Members of Parliament sit. The Prime Minister sits here as well, because they are a Member of Parliament. The people who sit in the House of Lords are called peers. Most peers are now appointed by the government. There are some who are hereditary [[Peerage|peers]] (their fathers were peers); and a few others, such as certain [[bishop]]s in the established [[Church of England]], and the [[Judiciary]] (Law Lords).  Scotland has its own devolved Parliament with power to make laws on things like education, health and Scottish law. Northern Ireland and Wales have their own devolved Assemblies which have some powers but less than the Scottish parliament. The United Kingdom Parliament remains sovereign and it could end the devolved administrations at any time.  ===Parliament=== [[File:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|left|thumb|249x249px|[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] has reigned since 1952.]] The British people are represented by members of [[Parliament]], not ruled by monarchs. After the [[English Civil War]], [[Oliver Cromwell]] became Lord Protector, and the monarchy was disbanded. Although the monarchy was restored after his death, the Crown slowly became the secondary power, and Parliament the first. Members of Parliament (called MPs) were elected, but until the early twentieth century, only men who owned property could vote. In the nineteenth century, more people were given [[suffrage]]. But in 1928, all men and women got the vote: this is called universal suffrage.  Parliament is in [[Westminster]] in London, but it has power over the whole of the United Kingdom. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland now each have their own parliaments but they have more limited powers. Scotland has the [[Scottish Parliament]] at Holyrood. Wales has the [[National Assembly for Wales]] in Cardiff and the Northern Ireland has the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] at Stormont. England does not have a separate parliament. There are also parliaments in the [[Isle of Man]] and in [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]] (the [[Channel Islands]], which are all independent island states for which the UK has [[Crown dependencies|some responsibility]] in international law.  Almost all members of Parliament belong to [[political party|political parties]]. The biggest parties are the [[Conservative Party]], [[Labour Party]], the [[Scottish National Party]] and the [[Liberal Democrats]]. Members of the same party agree to act and vote more or less together. A party with more than half the seats (a majority) forms the government; the leader of the party becomes the [[Prime Minister]], who then appoints other ministers. Because the government has a majority in Parliament, it can normally control what laws are passed.  ==Military== The United Kingdom has one of the most advanced militaries in the world, alongside such countries such as the [[USA]] and [[France]], and operates a large army ([[British Army]]), a sizable navy ([[Royal Navy]]) and air force ([[Royal Air Force]]).   From the 18th century to the early 20th century, the United Kingdom was one of the most powerful nations in the world, with a large and powerful navy (due to the fact it was surrounded by sea, so a large navy was the most practical option). This status has faded in recent times, but it remains a member of various military groups such as the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] and [[NATO]]. It is also still seen as a great military power.  ==Economy== The United Kingdom is a [[Development|developed]] country with the sixth largest [[economy]] in the world. It was a [[superpower]] during the 18th, 19th and early 20th century and was considered since the early 1800s to be the most powerful and influential nation in the world, in politics, economics (For it was the wealthiest country at the time.) and in military strength.   Britain continued to be the biggest manufacturing economy in the world until 1908 and the largest economy until the 1920s. The economic cost of two world wars and the decline of the [[British Empire]] in the 1950s and 1960s reduced its leading role in global affairs. The United Kingdom has strong economic, cultural, military and political influence and is a [[nuclear power]].  The United Kingdom holds a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]], and is a member of the [[G8]], [[NATO]], [[World Trade Organization]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. [[London]], the capital, is famous as being the largest centre of [[finance]] in the world.  ==Literature== {{see also|English literature}}[[William Shakespeare]] was an [[English people|English]] [[playwright]]. He wrote plays in the late 16th century. Some of his plays were ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Macbeth]]''. In the 19th century, [[Jane Austen]] and [[Charles Dickens]] were novelists. Twentieth century writers include the science fiction novelist [[H.G. Wells]] and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. The children's fantasy ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series was written by [[J.K. Rowling]]. [[Aldous Huxley]] was also from the United Kingdom.  English language literature is written by authors from many countries. Eight people from the United Kingdom have won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. [[Seamus Heaney]] is a writer who was born in [[Northern Ireland]].  [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] from [[Scotland]] wrote the [[Sherlock Holmes]] detective novels. He was from [[Edinburgh]]. The poet [[Dylan Thomas]] brought Welsh culture to international attention.  ==Education== The nature of [[education]] is a devolved matter in the United Kingdom. [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] have separate, but similar, systems of education. They all have laws that a broad education is required from ages five to eighteen, except for in Scotland where school departure is allowed from the age of sixteen.   Pupils attend state schools (academies, faith schools, grammar schools, city technology colleges) and other children attend independent schools (known as public schools).  Britain's universities such as [[University of Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford]], and London universities ([[University College London]], the [[London School of Economics and Political Science|London School of Economics]], [[King's College London]] and [[Imperial College London]]) collectively form the Golden Triangle of United Kingdom universities. A broader group of twenty universities form the Russell Group, which account for two thirds of research grants and contract funding out of the total of 100 universities.  == Media == The [[BBC]] is an [[organisation]] in the United Kingdom. It broadcasts in the United Kingdom and other [[Country|countries]] on [[television]], [[radio]] and the [[Internet]].  The BBC also sells its programmes to other broadcasting companies around world. The organisation is run by a group of twelve [[Governor|governors]] who have been given the job by [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]], on the advice of [[government]] [[Minister (government)|ministers]].   == Transport == Road traffic in the United Kingdom drives on the left hand side of the road (unlike the Americas and most of Europe), and the driver steers from the right hand side of the vehicle. The road network on the island of [[Great Britain]] is extensive, with most local and rural roads having evolved from Roman and Medieval times. Major routes developed in the mid 20th Century were made to the needs of the motor car. The high speed [[motorway]] (freeway) network was mostly constructed in the 1960s and 1970s and links together major towns and cities.  The system of [[rail transport]] was invented in England and Wales, so the United Kingdom has the oldest [[railway]] network in the world. It was built mostly during the Victorian era. At the heart of the network are five long distance main lines which radiate from [[London]] to the major cities and secondary population centres with dense commuter networks within the regions. The newest part of the network connects London to the Channel Tunnel from St Pancras station. The [[British Rail]] network is part privatised, with privately owned train operating companies providing service along particular lines or regions, whilst the tracks, signals and stations are owned by a Government controlled company called Network Rail. In Northern Ireland the [[NI Railways]] is the national railway. The system of underground railways in London, known as the [[London Underground|Tube]], has been copied by many other cities.  Most domestic [[air travel]] in the United Kingdom is between London and the major cities in Scotland and the North of England and [[Belfast]]. [[London Heathrow Airport|London-Heathrow]] is the nations largest airport and is one of the most important international [[Airline hub|hub]]s in the world. Other major airports with principal international service include London-Gatwick, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. An extensive system of [[ferry]] networks operates.  == Languages == Major languages spoken in the United Kingdom other than English include [[Polish language|Polish]] (500,000 approximate number of speakers in the United Kingdom), Eastern Panjabi or [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] (471,000), [[Bengali language|Bengali]] (400,000), [[Urdu]] (400,000), [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] (300,000), [[Greek language|Greek]] (200,000), Southwestern Caribbean [[Creole language|Creole]] English (170,000).<ref>{{cite web|author=Gordon, Raymond G.
