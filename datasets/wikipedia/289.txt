[1] London is the city region with the highest population in the United Kingdom. With it being located along River Thames, London has been a central city since it was founded by the Romans two millennia ago under the name Londinium. London's original city center, the City of London, which in 2011 had 7,375 inhabitants on an area of 2.9 km, is England's smallest city. Since the end of the 19th century, London has also been used for the urban region that has developed around this city center. [2] This area forms the region of London, as well as the Greater London administrative unit, [3] led by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. [4]  In modern times, London is one of the world's most important political, economic and cultural centers. This is not least due to the fact that London was the capital of the British Empire and thus for almost three centuries the center of power for large parts of the globe.  The city itself has around 9.1 million inhabitants (2018) [5], but if you count the entire metropolitan area of London (London Metropolitan Area), you reach around 15 million. The city is considered the largest in the EU by population. [6]  == Climate == London has a temperate climate with regular, light rain throughout the year. July is the warmest month, with an average temperature at Greenwich of 13.6  C to 22.8  C. The coldest month is January, with an average of 2.4  C to 7.9  C. The average annual rainfall is 583.6 mm, and February is normally the driest month. Snow is uncommon in London itself, although there is regular snow in the surrounding area; this is because the extra heat the big city generates makes the city about 5  C warmer than surrounding areas in winter.  == History == The [[Roman Britain|Romans]] built the city of ''Londinium'' along the River Thames in the year AD [[43]]  The name ''Londinium'' (and later 'London') came from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] language of the [[Prehistoric Britain|Ancient Britons]]. In the year AD 61, the city was attacked and destroyed. Then the Romans rebuilt the city, and London became an important trading hub.  After the decline of the Roman Empire, few people remained in London. This was partly because the [[Anglo-Saxon]] people of [[Sub-Roman Britain]] were primarily agricultural. Once the Romans had gone, trade with Continental Europe dwindled. In the [[9th century]], more people started living in London again. It became the largest city in England. However, it did not become the capital city of England until the [[12th century]].  After the [[railway]]s were built, London grew very big. Greater London has 33 [[London Boroughs]] (neighbourhoods) and a mayor. The old [[City of London]] is only a square mile in size but has its own Lord Mayor.  Another famous old part of Greater London is Westminster, which was always a different city from the City of London. In Westminster is [[Westminster Abbey]] (a cathedral), The Palace of Westminster (the [[Houses of Parliament]], with Big Ben), and [[10 Downing Street]] (where the [[Prime Minister]] lives).  == Events == * AD 43 - Londinium is founded by the Romans * 61 - Londinium is sacked by [[Boudica|Queen Boudica]] and the [[Iceni]] * 100 - Londinium becomes the capital of Roman Britain * 200 - The population is about 6,000 * 410 - The end of Roman rule in Britain * [[8th century]] - London is captured by [[Viking]]s * 885 - King [[Alfred the Great]] recaptures the city and makes peace with the Viking leader [[Guthrum]]. * 1045-50 - [[Westminster Abbey]] is rebuilt by [[Edward the Confessor]] who is buried there in January 1066. * [[1066]] - [[William the Conqueror]] is crowned in Westminster Abbey. * 1100 - The population is about 16,000. * 1300 - The population of London has risen to 100,000. * [[1381]] - The [[Peasants' Revolt]]  the first poll tax riots * [[1605]] - The [[Gunpowder Plot]] is stopped * [[1665]] - The [[Great Plague of London]] * [[1666]] - The [[Great Fire of London]] * 1780 - The [[Gordon Riots]] * [[1851]] - The Great Exhibition held at the Crystal Palace * 1908 - The Summer [[1908 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] take place in London. * 1940-1941 - London was bombed by [[Germany]] during [[World War II]].

The [[Islamic State]] has said they were responsible for both attacks.  ==Climate== London has an oceanic, or [[temperate climate]]. It is not usually very hot or cold. It is often cloudy. {{Weather box |location=[[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]] |single line=yes |metric first=yes |width = auto |Jan record high C = 17.2 |Feb record high C = 19.7 |Mar

The [[Victorian era|Victorians]] built many train systems in the mid-19th century (1850s). Their main stations are in London, and the lines go to every part of [[Great Britain]]. There were originally five major companies but the five companies became a national rail network in modern times.  There are five [[airport]]s, though only one is actually in London ([[London City Airport]]). There is the London end of the London{{ndash}}[[Birmingham]] [[canal]], which was important to the industrial 19th century.  The most used airport is Heathrow International Airport  although it is actually outside the city.  The metro or [[London Underground]] is a system of [[electric]] [[Railway|trains]] which are in London. It is the oldest underground [[railway]] in the world. It started running in 1863 as the ''Metropolitan Railway''. After the opening the system was copied in many other cities, for example [[New York]] and [[Madrid]]. Even though it is called ''the Underground'' about half of it is above the ground. The "Tube" is a slang name for the London Underground, because the tunnels for some of the lines are round tubes running through the ground. The Underground has got 274 [[Railway station|stations]] and over 408 [[km]] of [[Railway track|track]]. From 20062007 over 1 [[billion]] passengers used the underground.  == References == {{reflist|2}}  == Other websites == {{wikivoyage}} {{Commons category|London}} * [http://www.london.gov.uk/ London City Government] * [http://wiki.worldflicks.org/london.html WorldFlicks in London: Photos and interesting places on Google Maps] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213004225/http://wiki.worldflicks.org/london.html |date=2008-02-13 }}  {{London}} {{European capitals}} {{Hanseatic League}}  {{Use British English}}  [[Category:London| ]] [[Category:Olympic cities]]</text>
