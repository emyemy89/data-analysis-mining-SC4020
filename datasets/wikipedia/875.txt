It is also the largest [[city]] in both Ontario and Canada. Found It is on the north-west side of [[Lake Ontario]].  The City of Toronto has a [[population]] of over 3 million people. Even more people live in the [[region]]s around it. All together, the [[Greater Toronto Area]] is home to over 6 million people. That makes it the biggest [[metropolitan area]] in Canada.  ==History== Toronto was created in 1793 by [[John Graves Simcoe]] as the capital of what was then called ''"[[Upper Canada]]"''. At the time it was called the "Town of [[York]]" after the [[Duke of York]]. The name was changed to Toronto in 1834. With the Canadian [[Confederation]] in 1867, it became the capital of the newly created province of Ontario. Toronto was one of two cities (along with [[Montreal]] in [[Quebec]]) that wanted to be the capital of Canada. [[Queen Victoria]] decided that [[Ottawa]] should be the national capital because it was located between the two.  As the 19th century moved on, the city began to grow. This was mainly because of [[immigration]], where people from all over the world left their home and [[Immigration to Canada|moved to Canada]]. Many of the immigrants were [[Irish people]]. They brought their [[Catholicism|Catholic faith]] with them when they left [[Ireland]] because of the [[Irish Potato Famine]].  During [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], Toronto was used to train members of the [[Canadian Army]]. After the wars, even more immigrants came to the city. The population was becoming so big that the [[Government of Ontario]] decided to create [[Metropolitan Toronto]] in 1954, combining a number of local [[Municipality|municipalities]]. These were [[Old Toronto]], [[York, Ontario|York]], [[East York, Ontario|East York]], [[North York, Ontario|North York]], [[Etobicoke]], and [[Scarborough, Ontario|Scarborough]].  By 1981, Toronto had more people than Montreal even though it was created after Montreal. Because of that, the Ontario government decided to make Toronto a "[[megacity]]" in 1998. The first [[mayor]] of Toronto was [[Mel Lastman]]. As Toronto moved into the 21st century, it became host to a number of worldwide events. These included [[World Youth Day]] in 2002, [[WorldPride]] in 2014, and the [[2015 Pan American Games]].

[[Kppen climate classification]]). This is because although the city is next to Lake Ontario, the [[lake]] is not big enough to keep its [[temperature]] mild.{{Clarify|date=July 2019}}  As the biggest city in Canada and one of the biggest in all of [[North America]], Toronto is a popular destination for [[tourist]]s. It is where you can find the [[CN Tower]], which is the tallest free-standing (not supported) [[structure]] in the [[Americas]] and one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Modern World]]. There are some other buildings, including the [[Toronto City Hall|City Hall]] and the [[Rogers Centre]], that are well known for their design style. There are many [[skyscraper]]s, because many large [[bank]]s of Canada and other [[company|companies]] have their main offices in Toronto, and the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] which is the biggest [[stock market]] in Canada.  Because Toronto is the capital of Ontario, it is where [[Government of Ontario|the provincial government]] meets. Visitors can see how the province is run by visiting the [[legislature]] in Queen's Park. There are museums, including the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], the [[Ontario Science Centre]], the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], and the headquarters of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]. In the suburbs of the city is the [[Toronto Zoo]] and [[Canada's Wonderland]]. Many visitors also like to go to [[Niagara Falls]], just an hour's drive away from Toronto.  Toronto is full of places to visit, eat, shop, and enjoy. In the [[downtown]] area are [[shopping centre]]s, including the [[Eaton Centre]], [[St. Lawrence Market]], and the [[Distillery District]]. There are several [[theatre]]s, many which are run by the [[Mirvish]] family. The [[Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts]], opened in June 2006, is home to the [[Canadian Opera Company]] and the [[National Ballet of Canada]]. Across the [[harbor]] are the [[Toronto Islands]], the best known of which is [[Centre Island]].  Toronto has many [[sports]] teams. Some of them belong to [[Major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada|the most commonly-followed leagues]] in North America. They include the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in [[ice hockey]] (NHL) and the [[Toronto Raptors]] in [[basketball]] (NBA), both of which play in the [[Air Canada Centre]]. The nearby Rogers Centre is where the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] [[baseball]] team plays. [[BMO Field]] in [[Exhibition Place]] is home to the [[Toronto Argonauts]] in [[Canadian football]] and [[Toronto F.C.]], a [[soccer]] club.  Toronto is a very [[multicultural]] city. Different people from around the world have moved to Toronto to live since the 20th century. There is a Chinatown, Little Italy, Little Tokyo, Greektown, Little Portugal, and other places where different [[culture]]s are kept alive. These people hold [[festival]]s where they share their culture with others. Among the most popular is the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] (CNE), which happens every year in August.  ==Transport== Like many cities around the world, Toronto has an [[airport]], [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]]. There are [[air transport|flights]] to many places in Canada and the rest of the world. The airport is just northwest of the [[city centre]]. Since 2015, there has been a [[train]] service, the [[Union Pearson Express]]. It goes from the airport to Downtown in less than half an hour.  Toronto's main public transportation system is operated by the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] (TTC). The main part of its public transport network is the Toronto subway system. That system includes three heavy-rail rapid transit lines spanning the city, including the U-shaped [[Line 1 YongeUniversity|Line 1]] and eastwest [[Line 2 Bloor-Danforth|Line 2]]. A light metro line also exists, exclusively serving the eastern district of Scarborough. A discussion is underway{{when}} to replace it with a heavy-rail line. The TTC also operates an extensive network of buses and streetcars. The streetcars serve the downtown core. The buses provide service to many parts of the city not served by the sparse subway network.  The Government of Ontario also operates a commuter rail and bus transit system called GO Transit in the Greater Toronto Area. GO Transit carries over 250,000 passengers every weekday (2013) and 57 million annually. Most of them travel to or from Union Station. GO Transit is implementing RER (Regional Express Rail) into its system.  ==Housing== Housing in Toronto was ranked as 10th-least [[affordable housing|affordable]] in the world. The study compared Toronto with ninety other metropolitan areas in different countries. [[Hong Kong]] came in as the least affordable place to live in.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/why-ottawas-attempts-to-help-young-canadians-afford-housing-simply-wont-work Why Ottawas attempts to help young Canadians afford housing simply wont work &#124; Financial Post]</ref>  ==Gallery == <gallery> File:Rogers Center-restitched.jpg|The [[CN Tower]], as seen from the [[Rogers Centre]] during a baseball game.
