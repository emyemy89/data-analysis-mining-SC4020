It was invented in [[England]], and is played in most countries. In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], it is called '''soccer'''. In most other countries it is called '''football'''. Association football is the most popular sport in the world. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-are-the-most-popular-sports-in-the-world.html|title=The Most Popular Sports in the World|website=WorldAtlas|language=en-US}}</ref>   There were various attempts to codify the rules of football in England in the mid-19th century. The present laws date from 1863 when a set of rules was adopted in [[Rugby, Warwickshire]] by the newly formed [[Football Association]].   Each team has 11 players on the [[Association football pitch|field]]. One of these players is the [[goalkeeper]], and the other ten are known as "outfield players". The game is played by kicking a [[ball]] into the opponent's [[wikt:goal|goal]]. A match has 90 [[minute]]s of play, with a break of 15 minutes during the match. The break in the middle is called ''half-time''. Added time may be added after [[Half-time|half time]] or after 90 minutes to make up for time lost during the game because of fouls, [[Free kick|free kicks]], [[Corner kick|corner kicks]], [[Injury|injuries]], [[Red card|bookings]], [[substitutions]] or any other time the game is stopped. If a match ends in a tie, extra-time with two halves of 15 minutes each may be played, and if there is still a tie, a [[penalty shootout]] decides the winner. Sometimes [[Extra time|extra-time]] is skipped and the game goes right into the penalty shootout.  == Competitions == {{Sports}}  [[File:La mejor Hinchada de Futbol Argentino.jpg|thumb|In football, the fundamental purpose of the fans is to encourage their team during the match.]] There are many competitions for football, for both football clubs and [[country|countries]]. Football clubs usually play other teams in their own country, with a few exceptions. Here are a list of some of those exceptions: *{{flagicon|Wales}} [[Wales|Welsh]] teams {{FC|Cardiff City}} and {{FC|Swansea City}} play in the [[EFL Championship]] (the 2nd tier of [[England|English]] league system) and the [[FA Cup]] (the [[England|English]] cup competition) *{{flagicon|CAN}} [[Canada|Canadian]] teams {{FC|Vancouver Whitecaps}}, [[Toronto F.C.|Toronto FC]], and [[Club de Foot Montral|CF Montreal]] play in the [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] (the [[United States of America|USA]] league system) *{{flagicon|Monaco}} [[Monaco|Mongasque]] team [[A.S. Monaco F.C.|A.S. Monaco]] play in [[Ligue 1]] (the [[France|French]] league system)  Football clubs also play other teams in their [[continent]] in competitions such as the [[CAF Champions League]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]].   There are 6 associations ([[CONCACAF]], [[CONMEBOL]], [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]], [[UEFA]], [[AFC]], and [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]]). Each association has their own continental competition between clubs and national teams. Some examples are the [[Copa Amrica]] for CONMEBOL national teams and the [[Copa Libertadores]] for CONMEBOL clubs. [[FIFA]] organises international competitions between worldwide clubs and countries. Clubs play in the [[FIFA Club World Cup|Club World Cup]], and countries play for the [[FIFA World Cup]].  The [[FIFA World Cup]] takes place every four years between national teams, and is the world's most popular sporting event, even more popular than the [[Olympic Games]].<ref>[http://www.initiativemedia.com/static/prDec2006.html Worlds most watched TV sports events: 2006]</ref> In football, there are two main competition types. In a "league", all of the teams play the same number of games, but in a "cup", teams leave the competition when they lose, until the last two teams play each other to decide the winner.  == Who plays football == Football is the world's most popular sport. It is played in more countries than any other game. In fact, FIFA (the Federation Internationale de Football Association) has more members than the [[United Nations]]. It was originally an all-male sport, but today it is played by both [[male]]s and [[female]]s (separately, except sometimes at primary school level).      In Europe, the main competitions to compete are the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] for the top teams from the top leagues in each country in Europe. Then there is the [[UEFA Europa League]] which is for the next best teams from each member country of the [[UEFA]].  The most successful club in the world, in terms of domestic league results, is [[Rangers F.C.]] from [[Scotland]], who have won more domestic league titles than any other team in the world. They have won the [[Scottish Premier League|country's league]] 54 times<ref name="Number of league wins">{{cite news|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/kamprec.html#tnc|title=Total Number of Championships|date=4 June 2020|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation}}</ref> which is a world record. In May 2000, Rangers became the first team to win 100 trophies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/766841.stm|title=Rangers stars celebrate|date=27 May 2000|website=BBC Sport|access-date=2020-06-11}}</ref><ref name="100 trophies">{{cite news|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/rangers-100trophies.html|title=Glasgow Rangers - 100 Trophies|date=21 October  2001|access-date=11 June 2020|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation}}</ref> Other successful clubs are [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] from [[Spain]], [[Bayern Munich]] and [[Borussia Dortmund]] from [[Germany]], [[Galatasaray S.K.]] from Turkey, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[SSC Napoli|Napoli]] from [[Italy]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] from [[England]], [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] from [[France]], and [[Al Ahly SC|Al Ahly]] from [[Egypt]].  == Rules == === Fundamental rules === :''Note: this is not a complete summary'' * The side which scores the most goals wins. If scores are equal, the result is a draw. In cup competitions, there may be extra time and penalties to determine a winner. * The officials in a football game are a [[referee]] and two [[Linesman (soccer)|linesmen]].  * Goals are scored by getting the ball into the  opponents' goal, more than halfway across the line. ** Referees have access to goal-line cameras to decide close cases. ** The ''[[offside rule]]'' means that there have to be at least two defenders between the attacker and the defenders' goal when the attacker's teammate passes the ball to him/her. (This is not a complete summary: the rule is complex). Usually, one of the two defenders is the goalkeeper. * Players may not use their hands or arms (handball), except the goalkeeper, who may use them within his own ''penalty area'' (''penalty areas'' are in front of both goals). * The ball is out of play if it crosses the field boundaries. ** If a player hits the ball out of play at the side of the field, the other team gets to throw the ball back into play (a ''[[Throw-in|throw in]]''). ** If a player hits the ball out of play at their end of the field, the other team kicks the ball back into play from the corner (a ''[[corner kick]]''). ** If a player kicks the ball out of play at the other end of the field, the other team kicks the ball back into play from directly in front of the goal (a ''[[goal kick]]''). * Football is a game of two halves. Each half is 45 minutes.  The referee may add time to the end of each half when play is delayed due to injuries or substitutions.  There is an interval of ten minutes between halves. * Each team is allowed up to three substitutes from the bench during the course of a game. No player substituted can return during the game.  === Behaviour rules === * Players may not trip or push each other (a ''foul''). * Players may not hold each other or stop other players from getting to the ball (''obstruction''). * When a player scores he/she is not allowed to jump into the crowd. If he/she does they will get a yellow card. The same applies to lifting or removing their shirt in celebration. * Players must not abuse referees in any way (verbally or physically). * Players who commit bad fouls get shown a yellow card. Players who commit really bad fouls, or get shown two yellow cards in the same game, get shown a [[red card]]. Players who get shown a red card get sent off the field and cannot finish playing the game. In some competitions (like the Premier League in [[England]]) you miss the next game (suspended) if you get a red card, or pick up 5 yellow cards during the season.  == Related pages ==  *[[List of football federations]] *[[List of national football teams]] * [[List of Argentine football teams]] * [[List of Austrian football teams]] *[[List of football clubs in Armenia|List of football teams in Armenia]] *[[List of football clubs in Azerbaijan|List of football teams in Azerbaijan]] * [[List of Brazilian football teams]] *[[List of Colombian football teams]] *[[List of football clubs in Chile|List of football teams in Chile]] * [[List of Dutch football teams]] * [[List of English football teams]] * [[List of football clubs in France|List of French football teams]] * [[List of German football teams]] * [[List of Indian football teams]] * [[List of Italian football teams]] * [[List of Japanese football teams]] *[[List of Mexican football teams]] * [[List of Portuguese football teams]] * [[List of Russian football teams]] * [[List of Scottish football teams]] * [[List of Spanish football teams]] *[[List of football clubs in Sweden|List of football teams in Sweden]] *[[List of football clubs in Turkey|List of football teams in Turkey]] * [[List of United States soccer teams]]  == References == {{commonscat}} {{reflist}}   {{Association football positions}}  [[Category:Association football| ]] [[Category:Summer Olympic sports]]</text>
