<title>Special English</title><text>'''Special English''' is a simple form of the [[English language]].  It is used by a public [[radio]] station called [[Voice of America]], run by the [[United States]] [[government]] in Special English programs every [[day]]. Its [[new]]s and feature programs are read more slowly than usual, using fewer English [[word]]s and simple [[grammar]].    The [[content]]s of Special English programs are much easier to understand.  Special English is clearer and simpler, and it uses shorter [[sentence]]s.  It can also help someone whose English is weak to improve his or her English.  In some countries, for example [[China]], Special English is popular among [[people]] learning English.  Special English was first used on [[October 19]], [[1959]]. Special English started in that year as one of radio programs by the Voice of America. This broadcasts adopt slow space and simple English in order to increase understanding for millions of listeners.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidevoa.com/a/3794247.html#A%20NEW%20BEGINNING|title=A NEW BEGINNING|quote=In 1959, VOA inaugurated Special English--slow-paced, simplified English broadcasts--to facilitate comprehension for millions of listeners.}}</ref> It is now also known as "Learning English".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voanews.com/voa-learning-english|title=voa-learning-english|quote=Learning English use a limited vocabulary and are read at a slower pace than VOA's other English broadcasts.

And reports are paced 1/3 slower than regular English in order to allow listeners to increase a better understanding. This means broadcasters speak at about two-thirds the speed of conversational English. But far from sounding like a record played at the wrong speed.<ref name=":1" /> It now deals with various topics to keep interest of listeners, such as news, business, science, and culture. Stories are written in clear.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Special English|url=https://www.insidevoa.com/a/special-english/1381609.html|access-date=2020-08-11|website=VOA|language=en}}</ref>  To be a Special English broadcaster, he or she needs a complicated skill that takes months of training. The training includes a professional voice trainer who teaches how to breathe properly and pronounce clearly.<ref name=":1" /> A chief of Special English at VOA said, "People in this country have likely never heard of Special English," and also said, "and, if they have, they often don't understand the significance of it to people in other countries."<ref name=":1" />  One VOA staff explains that the main goal of Special English is for the listener to understand the content of what is being broadcast, and to make steady progress in English.  There is a fine line between being simplified and simplistic, he says. We never want to cross that line. So when necessary, more advanced English words are used and the meanings made clear, so the stories never suffer from incomplete information.<ref name=":0" />  Students and teachers in other countries say Special English is a good learning tool.<ref name=":1" />  == About programs == Some of popular programs on VOA follow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://learningenglish.voanews.com/programs/radio|title=Programs - Radio|website=learningenglish.voanews.com|access-date=2020-08-10}}</ref>  *Arts & Culture *American Stories *Health & Lifestyle *U.S.History *Science & Technology *Words & Their Stories *Learning English Broadcast VOA broadcast a program titled '[https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/willis-conover-voice-of-jazz/2955876.html Willis Conover, the Voice of Jazz, Is Now Online]" in the past, as Willis Conover<ref>{{Cite web|title=Willis Conover {{!}} American radio broadcaster|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Willis-Conover|access-date=2020-08-11|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> became a famous host at Music USA.  == Notes == {{reflist}}  ==Related pages== *[[Voice of America]] *[[Wikipedia:VOA Special English Word Book]]  == Other websites == *[http://www.voanews.com/specialenglish/ The VOA Special English Web Page] *[https://docs.voanews.eu/en-US-LEARN/2014/02/15/7f8de955-596b-437c-ba40-a68ed754c348.pdf VOA Special English Word Book] - 1,500 words used on VOA Special English broadcasts *[http://www.manythings.org/e/voa.html Voice of America Special English Study] - Online quizzes, listen and read along, crossword puzzles and more.
