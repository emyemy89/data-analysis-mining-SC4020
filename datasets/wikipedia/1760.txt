<title>Meat</title><text>[[File:French meat 0006.JPG|thumb|250px|Types of meat include beef, lamb, and pork]]  '''Meat''' is [[animal]] [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]] used as [[food]]. Most often is used to describe [[skeleton|skeletal]] [[muscle]] and [[fat]] that is found with it. Types of meat include [[beef]] and [[veal]] from [[cattle]], [[pork]], [[ham]] and [[bacon]] from [[pig]]s, [[mutton]] from [[sheep]], ''venison'' from [[deer]], [[fish]], [[insects]], and [[poultry]] from [[chicken]]s, [[duck]]s and [[turkey]]s. The word meat is also used for [[sausage]]s and for non-muscle [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] which are used for food, for example [[liver]], [[brain]], and [[kidney]]s.  In the meat processing [[industry]], (in some countries) the word "meat" is to mean only the flesh of [[mammal]]ian species such as [[pig]]s, [[cow|cattle]], etc. but does not include [[fish]], [[insect]]s and [[poultry]].   Meat is an important part of the diet of many people because it contains [[protein]]. Protein helps the growth and healing of a body and gives energy. Meat is a "high-protein" food, but costs more than other foods like [[bread]] and [[vegetable]]s. People who cannot afford meat, or who do not like to eat it need to find other ways to get enough protein in their diet. [[Bean]]s and certain [[nuts]] are also high in protein. People that choose not to eat meat are called [[vegetarian]]s, and those who do not eat any animal product are known as [[vegan]]s.  Animals such as members of the [[felidae|cat family]] that mainly eat animals are called [[carnivore]]s.   [[Red]] meat is darker-coloured meat, different from [[white]] meat such as chicken or fish. Some [[raw]] meat can make people [[illness|sick]] or even cause [[death]].{{fact|date=February 2020}}  {{food-stub}}  [[Category:Meat| ]]</text>
