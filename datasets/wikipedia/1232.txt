<title>Flag of the United States</title><text>{{no sources|date=December 2019}} [[File:Flag of the United States.svg|thumb|right|250px|The flag of the United States of America]] [[File:Flag of the United States (1777-1795).svg|thumb|right|250px|The original "[[Betsy Ross]]" flag.]] The '''flag of the [[United States|United States of America]]''' is a national [[flag]]. It has 7 red stripes and 6 white stripes. These 13 stripes represent the original [[thirteen colonies]]. The flag also has a blue ''canton'', a rectangle in the top left corner. The canton has 50 stars, one white star for every [[U.S. state|state]].  When a new state joins the United States a new flag is made with an extra star. The new flag is first flown on the 4th of July, <!-- Date not in wikiformat because it is used as an alternate name of Independence Day --> [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]].  The last states to join the United States were [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]] in [[1959]]. Alaska joined on [[3 January]] [[1959]], so the new flag with 49 stars was used from [[4 July]] [[1959]]. Hawaii joined on [[21 August]] [[1959]] so the flag with 50 stars that is used today was not flown until [[4 July]] [[1960]]. This 50 star design was created by [[Robert G. Heft]] for a school project.   The colors in the flag are [[red]], [[white]] and [[blue]]. The colors have no special meaning in the flag, but in the [[coat of arms]] white stands for purity and innocence, red for bravery and strength and blue for watchfulness, perseverance and justice.   The flag is also often called the '''Stars and Stripes''', the '''Star-Spangled Banner''', or '''Old Glory'''. The [[Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] of the United States is a reference to the flag.  == Design == * 13 [[horizontal]] red and white stripes, representing the original 13 states. * 50 white stars on a blue rectangle in the top-left, representing the current 50 [[U.S. state]]s.
