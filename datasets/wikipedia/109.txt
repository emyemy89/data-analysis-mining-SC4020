There are many types of cheese, such as [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar]], [[Swiss cheese|Swiss]], and [[provolone]].   Many things affect the [[form]], [[texture]], [[Colour|colour]] and [[flavor|flavour]] of a cheese. These include the milk ([[cow]] or [[goat]]), if the milk has been [[Pasteurization|pasteurized]], the amount of [[butterfat]], [[bacteria]] and [[mold]] in the cheese, how the cheese is made, how much fat is in the cheese, and how old the cheese is. Example for cheese used in a sentence: Todd the dog likes cheese.  == The origin of cheese == People have been making cheese since before [[history]] was written down.

The milk of [[cow]]s, [[goat]]s, and [[sheep]] are most popular. [[Buffalo]], [[camel]], [[donkey]] and even [[hippopotamus]] milk can also be used. Cheese makers usually cook the milk in large [[pot]]s.  Most cheeses are [[wikt:acidify|acidified]] by bacteria. This bacteria turns milk [[sugar]]s into [[lactic acid]].   [[Salt]] is added, and a [[substance]] from the [[stomach]] of young cows called [[rennet]]. This curdles the cheese and makes it solid. Some makers do not add [[rennet]], but curdle the cheese in other ways. [[Vegetarianism|Vegetarian]] alternatives to rennet are made by [[fermentation]] of a [[fungus]] called ''Mucor miehei''. Other alternatives use species of the ''[[Cynara]]'' [[thistle]] [[family (biology)|family]].<ref>Jenkins, Steven 1996. ''Cheese Primer''.

Some ways include: * How long the cheese was aged  * The [[texture]] of the cheese. These include Hard, Soft and Softer. * How the cheese was made * What type of [[milk]] was used to make the cheese.

The [[diet]] of the animal can also affect the type of cheese made from its milk. * How much [[fat]] is in the cheese * What color the cheese is (common colors are yellow, and white)  There are also man-made foods that some people use instead of cheese.
