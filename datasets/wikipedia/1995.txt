''Virginia Woolf''. Penguin.</ref><ref>Bell, Quentin 1972. ''Virginia Woolf: a biography''. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. Revised editions 1990, 1996</ref>  == Childhood == She was born into a well-known family. Her father, Leslie Stephen, was a Victorian scholar. Her mother, born in [[India]], was a favourite model of the [[Preraphaelite]] artists. Her sister, Vanessa Bell, was a painter. She had two brothers; one of them, Thoby, died in 1906.  Her mother died when she was thirteen and four years later her half-sister Stella died. In these times Virginia started to have her psychological, or mental problems. She had [[bipolar disorder]] in the time when few people knew this [[mental illness|illness]] and most thought she was strange.  After the death of her mother, Leslie Stephen was not able to keep good relations in the family. Virginia and her sister Vanessa were [[incest|sexually abused]] by their half-brothers George and Gerald. It affected Virginia for the rest of her life.<ref>DeSalvo, Louise 1989. ''Virginia Woolf: the impact of childhood sexual abuse on her life and work''. Boston: Little Brown.</ref>  In their childhood, all the Stephens children wrote diaries, but only Virginia kept it for her whole life (and after her death, lots of them were published). It was important for her when she was [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]], because there was no one with whom she could talk about it. In the diary, she could write everything.  ==Writing life== After her father's death, Virginia and her brothers and sister moved to [[Bloomsbury]], London and there they became members of the famous group of artists called Bloomsbury Group. Here Virginia met writer [[Leonard Woolf]] (1880-1969), whom she was [[marriage|married]] to from 1912 until her death. Together, they moved to [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], where they opened a publishing office called Hogarth House Press, which later published all of Virginia's novels and essays.  She was [[bisexual]]. When she was a teenager, she fell in love with Violet Dickinson and she wrote her lots of love letters. Violet probably never loved her back. Later, Virginia had a sexual relationship with [[Vita Sackville-West]], a writer and a poet. Their letters, which have been published, show how deeply they were in love.  [[File:Roger Fry - Virginia Woolf.jpg|thumb|left|A portrait of Woolf by [[Roger Fry]] c. 1917]] Her most famous novels are ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' and ''[[To the Lighthouse]]''. She completed ''Mrs Dalloway'' in 1925. It is about a day in the life of an English woman called Clarissa Dalloway. Clarissa is throwing a [[party]] and she spends the entire day preparing. The story can appear stupid, but it is not so important in the book. What's more important are the feelings, the colours, or the mood of the story.  ''To the Lighthouse'' was published in 1927 for the first time. It is about a family of Ramsays and its friends. These people are altogether spending a summer in Ramsay's house on an island. The youngest of Ramsays children, James, wants to go to the lighthouse, but they can't go there because of bad weather. In the next part of the book, James is ten years older and his father is taking him to the lighthouse, although he doesn't want to go there anymore.  Virginia Woolf is also an author of these novels: ''Jacob's Room'' (1923), ''Orlando'' (1928) and ''The Waves'' (1931). She was a [[feminist]] and she wrote a few essays about women's position in the society, for example ''The Room of One's Own'' and ''Three Guineas''.  == Death == On 28 March 1941, Woolf drowned herself by filling her overcoat pockets with stones and walking into the [[River Ouse, Sussex|River Ouse]] near her home. Her body was not found until 18 April.<ref>{{cite book|last=Panken|first=Shirley|title=Virginia Woolf and the "Lust of Creation": A Psychoanalytic Exploration|url=https://books.google.com/?id=de4UyeBbCIwC&pg=PA260|accessdate=13 August 2009|year=1987|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-88706-200-1|pages=260262|chapter='Oh that our human pain could here have ending'''Between the Acts''}}</ref>  Her husband buried her cremated remains beneath an elm tree in the garden of [[Monk's House]], their home in [[Rodmell]], Sussex.<ref>Wilson, Scott.

Kindle Edition.</ref>  == Portrayals in fiction == In 1998, [[United States|American]] writer [[Michael Cunningham]] wrote a novel in which she appeared, called ''[[The Hours]]'' (a winner of the Pulitzer award), which is best known because of the ''[[The Hours (movie)|same named movie]]'', in which the role of Virginia was played by [[actress]] [[Nicole Kidman]]. Kidman won an Oscar for her performance.  Rather better known is ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf]]'', in which her name is used as a catch-phrase by the lead couple. This was a play, and then a film starring [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Richard Burton]]. The film won five [[Academy Awards]].  == References == {{reflist}}  == Other websites == {{Div col|colwidth=30em}} * {{UK National Archives ID}} * [http://www.bl.uk/people/virginia-woolf Virginia Woolf] at the [[British Library]] * [http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/Virginia_Woolf Biography of Virginia Woolf on the Yale Modernism Lab] * {{Gutenberg author | id=Woolf,+Virginia }} * {{FadedPage|id=Woolf, Virginia|name=Virginia Woolf|author=yes}} * {{Internet Archive author |sname=Virginia Woolf}} * {{Librivox author |id=843}} * [https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/ Works by Virginia Woolf at University of Adelaide] * {{IMDb name}} * {{imdb character|9867|Virginia Woolf (Character)}} * [http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/monks-house Monk's House information at the National Trust] * [http://library.vicu.utoronto.ca/special/woolf/wlfindex.htm The Virginia Woolf Collection at the Victoria University (Toronto) Library Special Collections] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728142757/http://library.vicu.utoronto.ca/special/woolf/wlfindex.htm |date=2012-07-28 }} * [http://archives.nypl.org/brg/19159 Virginia Woolf collection of papers, 18821984 (bulk 19121940)], held by the Henry W. and Albert A.
