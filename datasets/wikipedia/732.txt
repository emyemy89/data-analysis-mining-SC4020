<title>Wikipedia:Bug reports</title><text>The bugs in the [[MediaWiki]] software should be reported at [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org Phabricator]. You can request new features in the same place. Wikimedia's Phabricator was launched in November 2014 to replace Bugzilla, which was launched in August 2004 to replace the old MediaWiki [https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=34373 bug tracker at SourceForge].  You can also find information about the MediaWiki software and ask questions on the special website[[mw:|mediawiki]].  Don't report errors in articles. Just click ''edit this page'' and make the change yourself. Or write it on that article's talk page.  ==Reported bugs==  === Forced lowercase ===  Currently, MonoBook skin (although very beautiful) nonsensically forces some UI stuff, like [[MediaWiki:Mycontris]], to be all in lowercase like it looks sexy or something. It is bad English and is misleading. --[[User:Menchi|Menchi]] ([[User talk:Menchi|Talk]])[[plural|<font color=#ffffec>.</font>]] 12:14, 29 May 2004 (UTC)  : Unless there is ''another'' MediaWiki message that uses lowercase ''I''. --[[User:Menchi|Menchi]] ([[User talk:Menchi|Talk]])[[plural|<font color=#ffffec>.</font>]] 12:23, 29 May 2004 (UTC)  ::Eeek. I've reported this at [[m:MediaWiki_1.3_comments_and_bug_reports#Capital_error_in_localisation|Meta]]. It's a problem for some other languages as well it seems. [[User:Angela|Angela]] 03:42, 30 May 2004 (UTC)  :::Adding <tt>li { text-transform: none; }</tt> to [[MediaWiki:Monobook.css]] fixed this. [[User:Angela|Angela]] 14:54, 24 Jun 2004 (UTC)  ===The $1 search=== Currently, if I search for anything in the Simple English Wikipedia search box, the results page includes the following statement: "For more information about searching Wikipedia, see $1."  See $1?  I'm guessing that's a missing text string or something, but it could be very confusing to users of the Simple English Wikipedia. [[User:Starblind|Starblind]] 14:41, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)  ===Non-existent categories===  If I add a category to an article and it doesn't exist, it doesn't go red anymore, it pretends to exist. It's getting annoying. [[User:Archer7|Archer7]] 19:05, 25 February 2006 (UTC) :Appears to be fixed. [[User:Archer7|Archer7]] 10:35, 26 February 2006 (UTC)  ===Screwed up dates===  Some of the dates in signatures have changed years, some even to March 2006. [[User:Archer7|Archer7]] 22:46, 2 March 2006 (UTC) :Oh, it is March 2006. But the message said 16th March 2006, when it was 16th March 2005. [[User:Archer7|Archer7]] 22:47, 2 March 2006 (UTC)  ===Category in preview===  When you press 'show preview' and the page is in a category, it doesn't show the category in the preview  ===Rollback=== Rollback has been applied for. <span class="nounderlinelink plainlinks" style="font-size:11px; font-family:georgia;"><span style="color:#666666;">Microchip</span>&nbsp;[http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Blockip&wpBlockAddress=Microchip08 <span style="color:#999999;" title="Secret bonus Easter Egg!"></span>] [[User talk:Microchip08|<span style="color:#999999;">talk</span>]]</font></span></span> 21:49, 25 October 2008 (UTC)  ===Trying to access [[Special:RecentChanges]] is giving me an error message=== When I try to go to Recent Changes, it gives me the following error message:  <code>[31a32497] 2012-12-11 04:00:26: Fatal exception of type MWException</code>  This is annoying, especially as I'd like to revert some vandalism here and Recent Changes is my main way of doing so.  [[User:Maniesansdelire|<font color="red" size="2px">Manie</font>]][[User talk:Maniesansdelire|<font color="blue" size="2px">sans</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Maniesansdelire|<font color="yellow" size="2px">delire</font>]] 04:03, 11 December 2012 (UTC)  {{tracked|38095}} :This is a known issue that came with a recent software update. Supposedly it happens when there's a high server lag. I think it's being looked into. [[User:Osiris|Osiris]] ([[User talk:Osiris|talk]]) 06:21, 11 December 2012 (UTC)  == Feature Requests == === English Wikipedia alway on Top of the Wikipedias List === I want to suggest placing the (regular) English Wikipedia on the first place in the list of available languages on the left of every article, as the English WP is most likely used most for translations and further searches. And this not only because it's the largest one, but also because it  basically is written in the same language. --[[User:Jackson|Jackson]] ([[User talk:Jackson|talk]]) 12:31, 7 August 2009 (UTC)  === Don't block edits, instead allow suggested updates === There are plenty of pages that are blocked to established users.  It would be nice if in this case, anonymous users could suggest a change that could be approved by an established user.  For example when iPad came out the article was blocked from anonymous users edits.  With this enhancement anonymous users would create a patch of there suggested update and people who are watching the page can approve or deny the request.  Could go a step further and automatically approve requests that haven't been denied with in 24 hours.  Thx, [[User:Daniel.Cardenas|Daniel.Cardenas]] ([[User talk:Daniel.Cardenas|talk]]) 23:24, 19 May 2010 (UTC) :{{tl|editprotected}}, and are you sure you're not talking about English Wikipedia?
