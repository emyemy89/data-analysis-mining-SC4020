There are no strict rules for what land is considered a continent, but in general it is agreed there are six or seven continents in the world, including [[Africa]], [[Antarctica]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australasia|Australiasia]] or [[Oceania]],<ref>Either are accepted terms</ref> and [[South America]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/134805/continent Continent] (2009).

The third most populous continent is Europe. The fourth most populous is North America, and then South America. In sub-Saharan Africa, the largest age group are denarians (in their teens). In north Africa, the largest age group are vicenarian (in their twenties). In Europe, most people are tricenarian (in their thirties) or quadragenarian (in their forties).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-09-08/these-maps-show-where-world-s-youngest-and-oldest-people-live|title=These maps show where the worlds youngest and oldest people live|website=Public Radio International}}</ref>  == Versions of the continent model == === Australia === Some sources say that Australia is one of the seven continents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/as.html#Geo|title=Australia - Oceania :: Australia  The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}</ref> Others say that Australia is part of a larger continent, such as Australasia, or [[Oceania]]. [[Oceania]] is a region which includes [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[Pacific Islands]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/au.htm|title=Australia Map / Oceania Map / Map of Australia / Map of Oceania - Worldatlas.com|website=www.worldatlas.com}}</ref> [[Australasia]] includes at least all countries on the Australian [[continental plate]]. This includes the islands of [[New Guinea]], [[Tasmania]], New Zealand and a number of smaller islands. It is on the south-eastern side of the [[Wallace Line]], with distinct differences in its biology from the Asian side of the line.  :"It includes all the islands of the Malay Archipelago... as well as the various groups of islands in the Pacific. The term has been used in very different senses".<ref>Wallace, Alfred Russel 1893. ''Australasia'', vol 1. London: Stanford. Chapter 1: Definition.</ref>  === North and South America === North America and South America together are often described as one continent, "the Americas", or simply "America". This has the advantage of including [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]] islands. Otherwise, Central America is counted as part of North America.  === Eurasia === [[Eurasia]] is not really an alternative, rather it is a recognition that the landmasses of Europe and Asia are continuous, and some of its largest countries are in both regions. [[Russia]] extends from eastern Europe to the far east of Asia without a break. The [[Ural Mountains]], which run roughly north/south, are the traditional dividing-line between Europe and Asia. For many purposes it is convenient to consider the great landmass as a single continent, Eurasia.  When [[Britain|British]] people talk about "the Continent" (or "Continental" things) they mean the [[Europe|European mainland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/continent.html|title=Encarta World English Dictionary|accessdate=2008-08-05|year=2007|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc.|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwRKDyZ6?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/continent.html|archivedate=2009-10-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> This meaning is not used as much as it used to be, but is still seen in phrases like "Continental [[breakfast]]" ([[bread|rolls]] with [[cheese]], [[jam]] etc. as distinct from an "English breakfast" which is a cooked breakfast).  Continents not only move but also sometimes move against each other. The Indian subcontinent has been colliding with the Eurasian continent for a while now. As these continents push against each other, they buckle and bend. Because of this, the [[Himalaya Mountains]], where [[Mount Everest]] is, are still being made today.<ref name=holt>{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Earth Science| publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston| date = 2001| location = United States of America| pages = 211| url =https://archive.org/details/holtsciencetechn00na_0| isbn = 0-03-055667-8}}</ref>  === Zealandia === Zealandia is an almost entirely submerged land mass, and 93% of it still remains under water.
