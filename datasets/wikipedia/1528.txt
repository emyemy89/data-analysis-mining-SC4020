<title>Agreement</title><text>[[Image:Handshake (Workshop Cologne '06).jpeg|thumb|A [[handshake]] is often used to mean there is an agreement.]] When people feel or think the same way about something, they agree. Sometimes it is important to write down or make a [[promise]] to what has been agreed on. This is called an '''agreement'''. Agreements are common in law and [[business]]. For example, when a person takes out a [[loan]] or [[employer|hire]]s someone to work, an agreement is usually signed so everyone understands what must be done and in what time it must be done.
