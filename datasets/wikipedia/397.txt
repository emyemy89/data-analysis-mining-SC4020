<title>Paradox</title><text>[[Image:Boyle'sSelfFlowingFlask.png|thumb|[[Robert Boyle]]'s self-flowing flask fills itself in this picture, but [[Perpetual motion|perpetual motion machines]] cannot exist.]] [[File:Pinocchio paradox.jpg|thumb|The [[Pinocchio paradox]] is a variant of the [[Liar paradox]]]] A '''paradox''' is a sentence in [[logic]] that cannot be [[true]] but also cannot be [[false]].  Many famous problems of this kind exist.  A famous paradox is called the '''liar's paradox'''. It is the [[simple sentence]] "This sentence is a [[lying|lie]]", or equivalently, "This statement is false."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-08-01|title=The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon|url=https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/|access-date=2020-10-08|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}}</ref>  If the sentence is true, then it is a lie as it says.  But if it is a lie, it cannot be true. A lie cannot also be a [[truth]]. So the sentence being true makes it a lie.  On the other hand, if the sentence is a lie, then it is not as it says: it is true.  But that is just what the sentence says, which makes the content of the sentence true.  So the sentence being a lie makes it true.  This paradox is not just true in English, but in any language powerful enough for a sentence to make a claim about itself. This is true of [[mathematics]] as well.  Paradox can never be removed from any [[symbol]] system that makes claims about itself.  Another example is the statement that "there is no cabal".  Only a [[cabal]] can know if there is no cabal, so this is either a guess, or, it is a cabal trying to pretend it does not exist.  Not all paradoxes are true logical paradoxes, since they can also be common-sense-defying statements that appear true.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Definition of PARADOX|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paradox|access-date=2020-10-08|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en}}</ref> Some famous examples of this kind of paradox include: * [[Zeno's paradoxes]] of [[motion (physics)|motion]] * [[Simpson's paradox]] in [[statistics]] * Grandfather paradox  A paradox can also arise in [[ethics]]. Assuming [[Influence|power]] over others may sometimes be required to protect them while diminishing their right to autonomy. This is defined as an [[:en:Ethical_dilemma|ethical dilemma]], which means "a paradox arising in ethics". Similarly, an ethical dilemma may be resolved by re-framing of the problem to reveal the false contradiction.   Because a paradox forces one to think "out of the box" about possibilities other than true or false in [[logic]], right or wrong in [[morality]], it is often brought up for educational purposes. People who do not see a paradox where others do are likely to be too [[wikt:Certain|certain]] that they are right.  ==Related pages== * [[Irony]] * [[Oxymoron]] * [[Buttered cat paradox]] * [[Thought experiment]] * [[:en:Ethical_dilemma|Ethical Dilemma]]  == References == <references /> [[Category:Logical paradoxes| ]]</text>
