Europe. The [[capital city]] is [[Belgrade]]. To the north of Serbia is the country [[Hungary]]. To the east of Serbia are the countries [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]. To the south of Serbia are countries [[Republic of Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and [[Kosovo]]. To the west of Serbia are the countries [[Montenegro]] (the country that was once united with Serbia), [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]].  ==History== The oldest form of writing comes from an ancient civilization which inhabited Serbia called the Vina culture and the symbols are called the Vina script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.korenine.si/zborniki/zbornik01/htm/pesic_vinca.htm|title=THE VINCHA SCRIPT|website=www.korenine.si}}</ref> Serbia is also home to the earliest known copper smelting sites and the birth of the Copper Age which lead humanity out of the Stone Age and into regular use of metallurgy.<ref>http://m.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=2146413558</ref> The same culture contains the earliest evidence of tin alloy bronze which replaced the much weaker arsenic bronze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://haemus.org.mk/6500-year-old-tin-bronze-from-serbia/|title=6,500-year old tin-bronze from Serbia - HAEMUS - Center for scientific research and promotion of culture|publisher=}}</ref>  === Medieval history ===  White Serbs, an early [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribe from Northern Europe, came to Northern Greece in the 6th century. By the 8th century they had created the Serbian Principality, a Serbian country, in the Balkans.<ref>Sima M. irkovi, SRBI MEU EUROPSKIM NARODIMA,(Serbs) 2008. http://www.mo-vrebac-pavlovac.hr/attachments/article/451/Sima%20%C4%86irkovi%C4%87%20SRBI%20ME%C4%90U%20EVROPSKIM%20NARODIMA.pdf #page=26-27</ref> The Serbs became Christian around the 10th century. For 200 years, the Nemanji dynasty ruled. They made Serbia a kingdom, built new towns, monasteries, and forts, and made Serbia bigger. In 1371 the Nemanjic Dynasty died out. Serbia became unsafe and local leaders fought each other for control. In 1389 the [[Ottoman Empire]] invaded Serbia. They fought against Serbia, [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]], the [[Knights Hospitaller]], and the forces of many other local leaders, and won. The Turks fought the Serbs for 70 years until in 1459 the Ottoman Turks conquered Serbia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fine|first1=John|title=The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest|date=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472082605|page=575|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?redir_esc=y&id=LvVbRrH1QBgC}}</ref>  === Ottoman period ===  Once the Ottomans conquered Serbia, they got rid of the Serbian upper class. Most Serbs worked as farmers on land owned by Turks. They had to pay high taxes to the Turks. Some Serbs were forced to become [[Islam|Muslims]]. But the Serbs had their own laws in the Ottoman Empire through the [[millet system]].{{sfn|Runciman|1968|p=204}}{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=115}} During the 19th century Serbia gradually became independent. During World War I Austria conquered Serbia but lost the bigger war. Serbia joined other Balkan countries to form [[Yugoslavia]].   ==Geography== Serbia is found in the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]] and the [[Pannonian Plain]]. The [[Danube]] passes through Serbia. The [[ar Mountains]] of [[Kosovo]] form the border with [[Albania]].
