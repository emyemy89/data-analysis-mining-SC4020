''Tuscarora English Dictionary'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999</ref> [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]]: ''Kaniatarowanenneh'', meaning "big waterway") is a big [[river]] in eastern [[North America]]. It flows between the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[province]] of [[Quebec]] & [[Ontario]] and the [[United States|American]] [[state]] of [[New York]], and through the major canadian city of [[Montreal]]. It is the third largest river in Canada.   The river drains water from the [[Great Lakes]] into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is more than three thousand [[kilometre]]s long. The river meets the Atlantic Ocean in a big "[[estuary]]" or bay, the biggest in the world; this is called the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]].  The Canadian cities of [[Kingston]], [[Montreal]], [[Trois-Rivires, Quebec|Trois-Rivires]] and [[Quebec City]] are on this river. The [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] allows [[ship]]s to go up the river and through the Great Lakes right into the middle of North America.  ==References== {{Reflist}}  ==Other websites== {{Commons category|Saint Lawrence River}} *[http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/205/301/ic/cdc/stlauren/ Regional Geography of the St. Lawrence River] *[http://www.greatlakes-seaway.com/ Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway System] *[http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/keys/webtours/VQ_P1_5_EN.html Safe Passage: Aids to Navigation on the St. Lawrence] &ndash; Historical essay, illustrated with drawings and photographs *[http://www.readingstlawrencecounty.com Annotated Bibliography on St. Lawrence County and Northern New York region.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050831065022/http://www.readingstlawrencecounty.com/ |date=2005-08-31 }} *[http://www.islrbc.org International Saint Lawrence River Board of Control] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723220909/http://www.islrbc.org/ |date=2013-07-23 }} *[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0007094 Saint Lawrence River from ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''] *[http://www.nfb.ca/film/St_Lawrence_Stairway_to_the_Sea/ Watch the Jacques Cousteau documentary, ''St. Lawrence: Stairway to the Sea''] *[http://digitallibrary.hsp.org/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/3885 The Steamboats "Sir James Kemp" and "Lord Dalhousie" on the River St. Lawrence, Upper Canada in 1833 by D.J.
