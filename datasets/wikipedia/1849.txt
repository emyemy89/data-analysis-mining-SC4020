<title>Anarchism</title><text>'''Anarchism''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical movement]] and [[Political|political movement]], that is against all [[wikt:enforced|enforced]] kinds of [[hierarchy]]. For example, anarchism says that the [[government]] is harmful and not needed. It also says that people's actions should never be forced by other people. Anarchism is called a [[libertarian]] form of [[socialism]].  Anarchism is a group of ideas centered on the belief that government is both harmful and not needed.<ref name=definitions2>''Anarchism''. The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2005. P. 14 "Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable."</ref><ref>Carl Slevin "anarchism" The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics. Ed. Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan. Oxford University Press, 2003.</ref> The word "anarchism" [[etymology|is from]] the [[Greek language|Greek]] , which means "without rulers", not "without rule"; it is also sometimes translated as "without government".  In the common language, the word ''anarchy'' is often used to describe [[wikt:chaos|chaos]] or [[anomie]]. However, anarchists usually do not want this. Rather, they define "anarchy" as a way of relations between people. They believe that, once put into place, these relations work on their own. Anarchists are usually opposed by the systems they wish to remove.  == Principles ==  Individual freedom, voluntary association, and being against the [[state]] are important beliefs of anarchism. There are also big differences between anarchist philosophies on things like whether [[violence]] can be used to bring about anarchy; the best type of economy; the relationship between technology and hierarchy; the idea of equality; and the usefulness of some organization. The word "authority" is not clear, but anarchists are not against some types of [[authority]] (e.g. the authority of someone skilled in self-defence over someone that wants to learn self-defence), they are only against control by force.  == References == {{reflist}}  {{Anarchism}}  [[Category:Anarchism| ]]</text>
