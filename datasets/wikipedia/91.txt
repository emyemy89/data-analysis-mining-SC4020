<title>Cooking</title><text>{{Other uses}} [[File:Bakken.jpg|thumb|Cooking food on a stove in a [[wok]]]] '''Cooking''' is a process to make [[food]] ready to eat by [[heat]]ing it. Cooking can kill bacteria that may be in the food.  [[Raw food]] is food that is not cooked. Some foods are good to eat raw.  Other foods are not good for the body when they are raw, so they must be cooked. Some foods are good to eat either raw or cooked.  ==Methods== Cooking is often done in a [[kitchen]] using a [[stove]] or an [[oven]]. It can also be done over a [[fire]] (for example, over a [[camping|campfire]] or on a [[barbecue]]).  The heat for cooking can be made in different ways. It can be from an open [[fire]] that burns [[wood]] or [[charcoal]]. It can be on a stove or in an oven that uses [[propane]], [[natural gas]], or [[electricity]].  There are several different ways to cook food. [[Boiling]] cooks food in hot water. [[Frying]] (deep or shallow) cooks food in hot [[butter]], [[fat]] or [[oil]].  [[Baking]] and [[roasting]] cook food by surrounding it with hot air. [[grill (cooking)|Grilling]] means cooking food on a metal grill that has heat under it.  People often cook [[meat]] by boiling, [[roasting]], [[frying]], or grilling it. Some foods such as [[bread]] or pastries are usually [[baking|baked]].  Usually food is cooked in some kind of [[pot]] or [[frying pan|pan]].  Sometimes people cook food by putting it directly into the fire, or by wrapping the food in [[leaves]] before they put it into the fire.  == Cooks == [[File:Cooks 050918 154402.jpg|thumb|Cooks at work.|left]] A person whose job it is to cook food may be called a ''cook'' or a ''[[chef]]''.
