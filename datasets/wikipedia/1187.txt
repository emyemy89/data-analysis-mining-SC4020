It is bordered by [[Austria]] in the southwest, [[Hungary]] in the south, [[Ukraine]] in the east, [[Poland]] in the north and [[Czech Republic]] in the northwest. Its [[capital city]] is [[Bratislava]], the only capital of the world that borders with other two countries. Other main cities are [[Koice]], [[Preov]], [[ilina]], [[Bansk Bystrica]], [[Trenn]], [[Nitra]] and [[Trnava]]. Slovakia has been a member of the [[European Union]] since 2004 and its official currency is the Euro.  == History == The [[Celt]]s started to settle since 450&nbsp;BC. The coins named ''Biatec'' represent the first use of writing in Slovakia. At the turn of millenniums, many different Germanic tribes like [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]] started to overtake the area. The [[Roman Empire]] established many outposts along the [[Danube]] river. They even fought Germanic tribes, with the most northern presence being in [[Trenn]] (''Laugaritio''), during the [[Marcomannic Wars]].  Great Moravia was at first in constant quarrels with the [[Eastern Francia]], and at the beginning of the 10th century, with the [[Magyars]] who arrived from Asia.  The Magyars conquered Great Moravia in 906, and established the Hungarian Principality, resulting later in the creation of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in year 1000.  Slovaks continued to live in the north, while most Hungarians were in the south.   A huge population loss resulted from the [[Mongol]] invasions in 1241.  The Hungarian kings started to invite other settlers, for example Germans in the 13th century, and many others started to arrive in the kingdom, [[Vlachs]] from [[Romania]] in the 14th century and [[Jews]].  In the 16th century the [[Ottoman Empire]] occupied the southern part of the kingdom including the two most important towns, [[Buda]] (capital) and [[Szekesfehrvr|Szkesfehrvr]] (coronation capital).  Many Hungarian nobles moved to Slovakia and the king moved to [[Bratislava]] (''Pressburg'', ''Pozsony'' at that time).  The wars against the Ottomans and an uprising against the [[Habsburg]]<nowiki/>s caused much destruction.  After the Ottomans started to [[retreat]] back from Hungary, Bratislava continued to be capital until 1848, when it was moved back to [[Budapest]].  The creation of a dual monarchy, [[Austria-Hungary]], enabled the Hungarian government to initiate a policy of suppressing the teaching of languages other than the Hungarian language in state schools. The official use of other languages than Hungarian was also discouraged. During this time, a nationalist movement arose among Slovakians. A part of this movement joined forces with a part of the Czech nationalist movement. During World War I, this movement convinced the future victorious powers to recognise a new state of Czechoslovakia after the war.  The territory of today's Slovakia was a part of [[Czechoslovakia]] from 1918 to 1938 and again from 1945 until 1989. Czechoslovakia was one of the states which came into existence after the breakup of Austria-Hungary at end of World War I in 1918. Czechoslovakia split up in 1939, when Slovakia, under [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s influence and pressure, declared independence and became an independent state. The state existed during [[World War II]]. It was a one-party totalitarian state which was a puppet ally of Nazi Germany. Under the regime, the state fought in the war on the side of Nazi Germany and deported about 70,000 of its Jewish citizens to Nazi extermination camps as part of the Holocaust.  The territory of Czechoslovakia was liberated by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II in 1945. After the liberation, Czechoslovakia was reunified and briefly existed as a democratic country. The Communist Party successfully performed a state coup in 1948 and ruled Czechoslovakia as a totalitarian one-party state which was a satellite of the Soviet Union. In 1989, the one-party rule of the Communist Party was overthrown during the [[Velvet Revolution]], which was a series of large and peaceful demonstrations by the citizens in the streets.  [[Czechoslovakia]] again became a democratic country. However, it split up into two independent countries (Slovakia and [[Czech Republic]]) on January 1, 1993 in what became known as the [[Velvet Divorce]]. Slovakia has been a member of the [[European Union]] since May 1, 2004.  == Geography == [[File:Slovakia topo.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Relief of Slovaia]] Slovakia is [[landlocked]]. It is noted primarily for its mountainous nature, with the [[Carpathian Mountains]] being in the north and various lowlands mostly in the south. The highest mountain range are the [[Tatra mountains]] with the highest peak, the [[Gerlachov Peak]] (Slovak: ''Gerlachovsk tt''; 2,654&nbsp;m). Major Slovak rivers besides the [[Danube]] are the [[Vh]] and [[Hron]].  At low altitudes, Slovakia's climate is [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] (''Dfb'' in the [[Koeppen climate classification]], with warm summers and cloudy, cold and humid winters. At high altitudes it is [[subarctic climate|subarctic]] and [[alpine climate|alpine]].  == Demographics == [[File:Kosice (Slovakia) - Main Street 4.jpg|thumb|right|Hlavn ulica (Main street) in [[Koice]]]] About 5.5 million people live in Slovakia.<ref>[http://countrymeters.info/en/Slovakia Slovakia Population clock]</ref> Most people are [[Slovaks|Slovak]] (86%), but in southern regions of Slovakia live [[Hungarians]] (10%), with some municipalities even being with the Hungarian majority (for example, [[Komrno]] or [[Dunajsk Streda]]), [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] or [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] are spoken in the northeast. A minority [[Roma people|Roma]] population speak versions of the [[Romany]] language and are scattered mainly in the east.  The Slovak constitution guarantees a freedom of religion. The majority of Slovaks are [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] (69%), the next are the [[atheists]] (13%). Other religions include [[Lutheranism]], [[Greek Orthodox]] and [[Calvinism]]. There are about 5,000 [[Muslims]] in Slovakia and 2,000 [[Jews]].  == Transport == * '''Rail''': Slovakia has 3,662&nbsp;km of rails, of which 3,512&nbsp;km are in standard gauge. Rail network currently undergoes a modernisation. * '''Road''': Slovakia has 42,993&nbsp;km of roads, of which 316&nbsp;km are motorways (2003).

The Danube and the Rhine-Main-Danube canal connects Slovakia to the [[North Sea]] and the [[Black Sea]].  == Administrative division == [[File:Slovakiakrajenumbers.png|thumb|right|240px|Regions of Slovakia]] There are currently 8 [[regions of Slovakia]]:  # [[Bratislava Region]] (''Bratislavsk kraj'') (capital [[Bratislava]]) # [[Trnava Region]] (''Trnavsk kraj'') (capital [[Trnava]]) # [[Trenn Region]] (''Treniansky kraj'') (capital [[Trenn]]) # [[Nitra Region]] (''Nitriansky kraj'') (capital [[Nitra]]) # [[ilina Region]] (''ilinsk kraj'') (capital [[ilina]]) # [[Bansk Bystrica Region]] (''Banskobystrick kraj'') (capital [[Bansk Bystrica]]) # [[Preov Region]] (''Preovsk kraj'') (capital [[Preov]]) # [[Koice Region]] (''Koick kraj'') (capital [[Koice]])  These are further divided into many districts. There are currently 79 [[districts of Slovakia]].  ==Related pages== * [[List of rivers of Slovakia]] * [[Slovakia at the Olympics]] * [[Slovakia national football team]] * [[Slovakia men's national ice hockey team]]  == References == {{Reflist|refs= <ref name="gov-stats">{{cite web |title=Slovakia: Ethnicity of the Population Section |publisher= Government of Slovakia |year=2010 |url=http://www.government.gov.sk/10134/slovakia.php?menu=1293 |accessdate=5 October 2010}}</ref> }}  == Other websites == {{commons|Slovakia}} * [https://archive.is/20121224202547/www.government.gov.sk/10887/government-office-of-the-slovak-republic.php The Slovak Republic Government Office]  {{Europe}} {{European Union}} {{North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)}}  [[Category:1993 establishments in Europe]] [[Category:European Union member states]] [[Category:Landlocked countries]] [[Category:Slovakia| ]] [[Category:States and territories established in the 1990s]]</text>
