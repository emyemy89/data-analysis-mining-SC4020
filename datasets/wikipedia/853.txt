<title>Argon</title><text>{{Infobox argon}} '''Argon''' is a [[chemical element]]. The symbol for argon is '''Ar''', and its [[atomic number]] (or [[proton]] number) is 18. It is a [[noble gas]] and no [[electron]]s or protons can be lost or gained from this atom.  Argon [[atom]]s are found in [[air]]. About 1% of the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]] (the air around us) is argon.  Argon is often used when welding steel and similar work, to push away the air around the weld, so the oxygen in the air can't join with the metal being welded.   ==Related pages== * [[List of common elements]] * [[Periodic table]]  ==Sources== {{reflist}} {{Periodic Table}} {{authority control}} [[Category:Noble gases]]</text>
