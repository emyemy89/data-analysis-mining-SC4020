<title>Linear algebra</title><text>'''Linear algebra''' is a branch of [[mathematics]]. It came from [[mathematicians]] trying to solve systems of [[linear equation]]s. [[Vectors]] and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] are used to solve these systems. The main objects of study currently are [[vector space]]s and [[linear mapping]]s between vector spaces. Linear algebra is useful in other branches of mathematics (e.g. [[differential equations]] and [[analytic geometry]]). It can also be applied to the real world in areas such as [[engineering]], [[physics]] and [[economics]].  Linear [[algebra]] describes ways to [[wikt:solve|solve]] and manipulate (rearrange) systems of linear [[equation]]s.  For example, consider the following equations:  :<math>\begin{matrix}  x &+& y &=& 0 \\  x &-& 2y &=& 3 \end{matrix}</math>  These two equations form a system of linear equations. It is linear because none of the [[variable]]s are raised to a [[exponentiation|power]]. The [[graph]] of a '''linear''' equation in two variables is a [[straight]] [[line]]. The solution to this system is:  :<math>\begin{matrix}  x &=& 1 \\  y &=& -1 \end{matrix}</math>  This is because it makes all of the original equations valid, that is, the [[value]] on the left side of the [[equals sign]] is exactly the same as the value on the right side for both equations.  Linear algebra uses a system of notation for describing system behavior, called a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. For the previous example, the [[coefficient]]s of the equations can be stored in a coefficient matrix.  ==Related pages== <!--alphabetical order--> * [[Matrix analysis]] * [[Matrix function]] * [[Numerical linear algebra]] * [[System of linear equations]]  ==Further reading== * [[Israel Gelfand]] (1998), Lectures on linear algebra, Courier Dover Publications.  {{authority control}}   {{Math-stub}}  [[Category:Linear algebra| ]]</text>
