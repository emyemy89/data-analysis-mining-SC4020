His central work, the ''[[Divine Comedy|Commedia]]'' (''Divine Comedy''), is considered the greatest literary work composed in the [[Italian language]] and a masterpiece of world [[literature]]. In Italian he is known as "the Supreme Poet" (''il Sommo Poeta''). Dante and the ''Divine Comedy'' have been a source of [[inspiration]] for artists for almost seven centuries. Dante, alongside [[Petrarch]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], is known as one of "the three fountains", and is often referred to as "the Father of the Italian language". The first biography written on him was by his contemporary [[Giovanni Villani]]. The most famous section in ''The Divine Comedy'' is the first third of it, the first 34 cantos of the poem, called ''Inferno'', which features Dante's vision of [[Hell]].  == Life == Dante Alighieri was born in 1265, between May 14 and June 13, under the name "Durante Alighieri." ca. 1450 ([[Uffizi]] Gallery). His family was important in Florence, and supported the [[Papacy]]. The poet's mother was Bella degli Abati. She died when Dante was seven years old, and Alighiero soon married again, to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi. Lapa had two children, Dante's brother Francesco and sister "Tana" ( short version of "Gaetana").  Dante fought in the front of the [[Guelph]] troops in the [[battle of Campaldino]] (June 11, 1289). After the victory Dante gained an important part in public life.  When Dante was 12, in 1277, he married Gemma di Manetto Donati. Dante had already fallen in love with another girl, [[Beatrice Portinari]] that is mentioned same in "Divine Comedy", (known also as Bice). Years after Dante's marriage to Gemma he met Beatrice again. He had become interested in writing poems.  Dante had six children with Gemma: Jacopo, Pietro, Giovanni, Gabrielle Alighieri, and Antonia.  == Education, youth and poetry ==  Not much is known about Dante's education, and it is presumed he studied at home. It is known that he studied [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[poetry]]. His interests brought him to discover the [[Occitan language|Occitan]] poetry of the [[troubadours]] and the [[Latin]] poetry of classical [[Ancient history|antiquity]] (with a particular devotion to [[Virgil]]). At 18, Dante met [[Guido Cavalcanti]], [[Lapo Gianni]], [[Cino da Pistoia]], and soon after [[Brunetto Latini]]; together they became the leaders of ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]'' ("The Sweet New Style"). Brunetto later received a special mention in the ''Divine Comedy'' (''Inferno'', XV, 28), for what he had taught Dante.  According to his work, ''[[La Vita Nuova]]'', when he was nine years old he met [[Beatrice Portinari]], daughter of Folco Portinari, with whom he fell in love "at first sight", and apparently without even having spoken to her. He saw her frequently after age 18, often exchanging greetings in the street, but he never knew her wellhe effectively set the example for the so-called "[[courtly love]]". Dante gave his imprint to the Stil Novo. Love for Beatrice (as in a different manner [[Petrarch]] would show for his Laura) would apparently be the reason for poetry and for living, together with political passions. In many of his poems, she appears such as semi-divine, watching over him constantly.  When Beatrice died in 1290, Dante tried to find "help" in [[Latin]] literature.  He then dedicated himself to philosophical studies at religious schools like the Dominican one in [[Santa Maria Novella]]. This "excessive" passion for philosophy would later be criticized by the character Beatrice, in ''Purgatorio'', the second book of the ''Divine Comedy''.  [[File:Dante Alighieri01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Statue of Dante at the [[Uffizi]], Florence.]]  == Exile and death == Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time ([[November 1]], [[1301]]), [[Charles de Valois]] entered Florence with [[Black Guelphs]], who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies. A new Black Guelph government was installed and Messer Cante dei [[Gabrielli]] di [[Gubbio]] was appointed ''[[Podest]]'' of Florence. Dante was put in [[exile]] for two years, and ordered to pay a large hill of money.  Dante did not pay the money, in part because he believed he was not guilty, and in part because all his needs in Florence had been stolen by the Black Guelphs. He was condemned to exile for life, and if he returned to Florence without paying the money, he could be burned at the stake.  In exile he began searching the foundation for the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', a work in 100 [[canto]]s, divided into three books of thirty-three cantos each, with a single introductory canto.  He went to [[Verona, Italy|Verona]] as a guest of [[Bartolomeo I della Scala]], then moved to [[Sarzana]] in [[Liguria]]. Later, he is supposed to have lived in [[Lucca]] with Madame Gentucca. Some not sure sources say that he was also in [[Paris]] between 1308 and 1310. In 1310, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of [[Luxembourg]], marched 5,000 troops into Italy. Dante saw in him a new [[Charlemagne]] who would restore the office of the Holy Roman Emperor for re-take Florence from the Black Guelphs. He wrote to Henry and several Italian princes, demanding that they destroy the Black Guelphs. Mixing religion and private concerns, he [[:wikt:invoke|invoked]] the worst anger of [[God]] against his city, suggesting several particular targets that coincided with his personal enemies. It was during this time that he wrote the first two books of the ''Divine Comedy''.  When Dante died at Ravenna, the custodians of the body at [[Ravenna]] put the bones in a false wall of the monastery. Nevertheless, in 1829, a tomb was built for him in Florence in the basilica of [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze|Santa Croce]]. That [[tomb]] has been empty ever since, with Dante's body remaining in Ravenna, far from the land he loved so dearly. The front of his tomb in Florence reads ''Onorate l'altissimo poeta''  which roughly translates as "Honour the most exalted poet".  ==Gallery== <gallery> File:Dante Npoles.jpg|Statue of Dante in the Piazza Dante in Naples File:Dante.deathmask.jpg|A recreated [[death mask]] of Dante Alighieri (in [[Palazzo Vecchio]], Florence) File:DanteflorenceCEL.jpg|The [[cenotaph|memorial tomb]] for Dante Alighieri at [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze|Basilica di Santa Croce]] in Florence File:Dantes tomb ravenna.jpg|Dante's tomb in Ravenna, built in 1780 File:Dante Alighieri de perfil.jpg|Dante by [[Erminio Blotta]], at Blvd. Oroo [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], [[Argentina]] </gallery>  ==Other websites== * [http://www.greatdante.net "Dante Alighieri on the Web"], about the Dante's life, and (complete) work. * [http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Banquet-Il-Convito-1.html The Banquet (Il Convito)] * [http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/Guides2/DivineCom.html#Dante%20Home The Divine Comedy: A Study Guide about Divine Comedy] * [http://www.centocanti.it/template/contenuto.asp?IDFolder=195&LN=IT The Divine Comedy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508211327/http://www.centocanti.it/template/contenuto.asp?IDFolder=195&LN=IT |date=2007-05-08 }} {{in lang|it}} * [http://www.readprint.com/author-2/Dante-Alighieri Dante Alighieri] and his Divine Comedy in English on [http://www.readprint.com Read Print] * [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Fperson=23&Itemid=28 The Online Library of Liberty: Dante's Divine Comedy] Italian text with English translation, Cambridge, 1918. * [http://www.danteonline.it/english/home_ita.asp Societ Dantesca Italiana (bilingual site)] manuscripts of Dante's works, images and text transcripts * [http://books.guardian.co.uk/authors/author/0,5917,-2,00.html Guardian Books: small "Author Page"] * [http://www.litweb.net/biography/205/Dante_Alighieri.html LitWeb.net: Dante Alighieri Biography] * [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dante/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Another biography, on his works and bibliography] {{Authority control}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Alighieri, Dante}} [[Category:1265 births]] [[Category:1321 deaths]] [[Category:Italian poets]] [[Category:Medieval poets]] [[Category:People from Florence]] [[Category:Writers from Tuscany]]</text>
