However, the head of state may not have very much real power.  In a modern [[republic]], the head of state is a [[president]], usually [[election|elected]] by the people or by a [[parliament]]. In a [[monarchy]], the head of state is the [[king]] or [[queen]]. Some countries have different systems - for example [[Recep Tayyip Erdoan]] of [[Turkey]] is both the Head of State and Head of Government which is known as an executive system.   In a modern [[monarchy]], the head of state usually has little real power. Instead, the most powerful person is the [[head of government]]. This is usually the leader of the [[political party]] that wins the most seats in an [[election]]. In these cases, the king is considered to be the leader of the country, but must always take the decisions that the head of government advises them to make. The king or queen carries out national ceremonies. The [[United Kingdom]] works like this, with the [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] heading the government.  A president may be the most powerful person in the country. This is true in the [[United States]]. However, sometimes there is a head of government, as well as a president. The president then acts very much like a king or queen, leaving the real decisions to the head of government. The [[Republic of Ireland]] works like this.   In older times, and in some modern countries, the head of state has absolute power, this called an [[absolute monarchy#Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchy]] which the [[Pope]] in the [[Vatican]] has.   {{Politics-stub}}  [[Category:Heads of state| ]]</text>
