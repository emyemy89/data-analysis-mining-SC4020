The area was made of a group of separate states, ruled by other countries (such as Austria, France, and Spain).  In the 1850s the [[Earl]] of [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]] was the Head of Government of the "State of Sardinia". He talked to the Austrians in Lombardy and Veneto and said they should create a Northern Italian state. This happened, but other Central and Southern Italian states also joined Piedmont to create a bigger state.  In 1860, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] took control of Sicily, creating the Kingdom of Italy in 1861.<ref name=Encarta /> [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]] was made the king. But in 1861, Latium and Veneto were still not part of Italy, because they were ruled by the [[Pope]] and Austrian Empire.  Veneto was made part of Italy in 1866 after a war with Austria, and Italian soldiers won Latium in 1870. That was when they took away the Pope's power. The Pope, who was angry, said that he was a prisoner to keep [[Catholicism|Catholic]] people from being active in politics. That was the year of [[Italian unification]].  Italy participated in [[World War I]] as an [[ally]] of [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and Russia against the [[Central Powers]]. Almost all of Italy's fighting was on the Eastern [[border]], near Austria. After the "[[Caporetto]] defeat", Italy thought they would lose the war. But, in 1918, the Central Powers [[wikt:surrender|surrender]]ed, and Italy gained the Trentino-South Tyrol, which once was owned by Austria.  In 1922, a new Italian government started. It was ruled by [[Benito Mussolini]], the leader of [[Fascism]] in Italy. He became [[Head of Government]] and [[dictator]], calling himself "duce" - which means "[[leader]]" in [[Italian language|Italian]]. He became friends with German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]]. [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], and Italy became the [[Axis Powers]] and entered [[World War II]] together in 1940 against France, Great Britain, and later the [[Soviet Union]]. During the war, Italy controlled most of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  On July 25, 1943, Mussolini was removed by the Great Council of Fascism, and, on September 8, 1943, [[Badoglio]] said that the war as an ally of Germany was ended. Italy started fighting as an ally of France and the UK, but Italian soldiers did not know whom to shoot. In Northern Italy, a [[wikt:movement|movement]] called [[Italian resistance movement|Resistenza]] started to fight against the German [[invasion|invaders]].  Mussolini tried to make a small Northern Italian [[Fascism|fascist]] state, the [[Republic of Sal]], but it failed. On [[April 25]], 1945, Italy became free. The state became a republic on [[June 2]], 1946, and, for the first time, women were able to vote. Italian people ended the Savoia [[dynasty]] and adopted a republic government.  In February 1947, Italy signed a peace treaty with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] losing all the colonies and some territorial areas: ([[Istria]] and parts of [[Dalmatia]]).  Since then Italy has joined [[NATO]] and the European Community (as a founding member), becoming one of the seven biggest industrial economies in the world.  == Transportation == [[File:Rom Fiumicino Airport 2008 by-RaBoe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport|Rome-Fiumicino Airport]] was the [[List of the busiest airports in Europe|sixth busiest airport]] in Europe in 2008.]] The [[Rail transport|railway]] [[wikt:network#Noun|network]] in Italy totals {{convert|16,627|km}}, the 17th longest in the world.
