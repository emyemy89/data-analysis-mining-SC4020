It is the western part of the [[Scandinavia]]n [[peninsula]].  The [[mainland]] of Norway is surrounded by the [[North Sea]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]] on the west side, and [[border]]s [[Russia]], [[Finland]], and [[Sweden]] to the east.  The southern coast touches the [[Oslofjord]], [[Skagerrak]], and the [[North Sea]].  The Monarchy of Norway has been [[independent]] since 1814. Its [[head of state]] is a king - [[Harald V of Norway|Harald the 5th]] (as of 2017).  The national day is May 17, which celebrates Norway's [[constitution]] of 1814. The parliament is called ''Stortinget'' and its members are [[election|elected]] by the people every 4 years.  About 5 million people live in Norway.  The [[Capital (city)|capital]] is the city of [[Oslo]].  [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] is the national language. There are two official written versions of Norwegian called ''[[Bokml]]'' and ''[[Nynorsk]]''.  The [[Northern Sami]] language is spoken by around 90% of those who speak one of Norway's 3 Sami languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/nordsamisk|title=nordsamisk|first=Svenn-Egil Knutsen|last=Duollj|date=26 November 2018|via=Store norske leksikon}}</ref> Northern Sami is also an official language in a number of [[municipality|municipalities]].  == History ==  The battle of Hafrsfjord (872 A.D.) resulted in small kingdoms becoming one larger kingdom, ruled by [[Harald Fairhair]].

In 1905 [[Prince Carl of Denmark]] was elected [[King of Norway]]. His name as a king, was [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]].  In [[World War I]], Norway was neutral and served as a trading nation.  Norway tried to stay neutral in [[World War II]], but was occupied by German forces from 9 April 1940 to 8 May 1945.  In 1952 Norway became a member of [[NATO]].  Oil was found in Norway's part of the [[North Sea]], during the 1960s; the oil was found under the [[sea floor]].  ===Royal family since 1905=== [[King Haakon VII]] was already married, before he came to Norway (in 1905). His wife, Princess Maud, became [[Maud of Norway|Queen Maud]]. Their son, Prince Alexander of Denmark, became Crown Prince Olav and followed after his father as [[Olav V of Norway|King Olav V]] in 1957. Olav and his wife, [[Crown Princess Mrtha of Norway|Crown Princess Mrtha]], had three children; Princess Ragnhild, Princess Astrid and Prince Harald (later Crown Prince Harald and in 1991 he followed his father as [[Harald V of Norway|King Harald V]]).  King Harald is the first king born in Norway in over 600 years. He has two children; Princess Mrtha Louise and [[Crown Prince Haakon of Norway|Crown Prince Haakon Magnus]].  == Government == === Ministry of Defence === The Government has Norwegian soldiers working in [[Syria]] (as of 2017)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.klassekampen.no/article/20170724/ARTICLE/170729959|title=Norge i Syria|website=Klassekampen}}</ref> and [[Afghanistan]], together with soldiers from other countries that belong to [[NATO]].  == Economy == [[Exports]] include : [[natural gas]], [[oil]], [[hydroelectric]] power, and [[fish]]. Other [[natural resource]]s are  [[agriculture]], [[forest]]s, and [[mineral]]s.  The government collects much money from various sources, and has policies intended to spread this wealth among Norwegians. This spread of wealth, is done both directly and indirectly.  == Ethnicity == Most people in Norway are ethnic Norwegians. They speak a language that is related to German and English. Swedish and Danish are so close to Norwegian that most Norwegians understand them. Across Norway, many different dialects are spoken. Norwegians disagree on how to make one correct written language. Therefore, there are two standard languages, Bokml and Nynorsk. Nynorsk is used in writing in most of the western areas and in the central mountains. Bokml is written by most people in the rest of the country.  A native population of Norway, the [[Sami people]], has its home in the northern parts of the country. Their language is not at all related to Norwegian. In some parishes in the far north, they make up the majority of people. Many Sami now live outside the Sami homeland, mostly in Oslo and other big cities. Earlier, Sami people were forced to speak Norwegian in school. Now Sami is taught as the first language in school for Sami children, and Norwegian is the first foreign language.  Many immigrants have come to Norway in the last 3040 years. They mostly live in and around Oslo, and in the other big cities. Many immigrants come from nearby countries, like Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Poland and Russia. There are also many from countries far away, such as [[Pakistan]], [[Somalia]], [[Iraq]] and [[Vietnam]].  Traditionally, all Norwegians were [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], a variety of the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] faith. Still, more than 80% of Norwegians are Lutherans. Other important faiths include [[Islam]], other Protestant groups and [[Catholicism]].  === Tourism === Among tourists to Norway, more come from [[Germany]] than from any other country. There are also many Swedes, Danes, British, Dutch and Italians visiting Norway. The Swedes and Danes often come in winter to go skiing. The others mainly come in summer. Many people visit Norway to see the Northern Lights, also known as the 'Aurora Borealis'.  == Media == The largest national newspapers in Norway are [[Verdens Gang]] (VG), [[Aftenposten]] and [[Dagbladet]].  == Culture == Norwegian culture can be compared to English culture in the way that it is considered a bad thing to show off, as opposed to the US, where this is more acceptable. This is a big aspect of Norwegian culture, and it is related to the philosophy of [[egalitarianism]]. Because of this, people will understate things, for example if a Norwegian says something is good or nice, it can mean that it's really great.  [[Item]]s from the Viking Age (in Norway), are shown in museums: One item is the [[Gokstad ship]].  Museums in Norway includes [[The Ibsen Museum]] - named after [[Henrik Ibsen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ibsenmuseet.no/en|title=Forside - Ibsenmuseet|website=ibsenmuseet.no}}</ref>  The farmers' culture (''bondekulturen'') was brutal.<ref name=ForestKillingsOfBabies>{{cite web|url=http://www.vl.no/verdidebatt/innlegg/11694976-myter-og-unoyaktigheter|title=Myter og unyaktigheter|website=www.vl.no}}</ref> Unwanted babies were "placed in the [[forest]]" (''sette barn p skogen'') to die, until the [[nineteenth century]]; in the end, the [rural] police authority - consisting of individuals called [[lensmann]] [[:en:Lensmann|(en)]] - were able to control [and stop] these [[crime]]s.<ref name=ForestKillingsOfBabies/>  Modern, cambered skis were invented in the Norwegian province of Telemark in the early 19th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skiinghistory.org/history/short-history-skis-0|title=A SHORT HISTORY OF SKIS|website=Skiing History|access-date=2019/07/23}}</ref>  == Politics == In Norway power is shared among three branches: The justice sector, the government and the [[parliament]] ([[Stortinget]]). Norway also has a king, [[Harald V of Norway|Harald V]], but he does not have any real power and acts as a symbol and [[ambassador]]. This form of government is called a [[constitutional monarchy]]. Elections are held every four years, and the winner of the election is the party or [[coalition]] of parties that gets the most votes and seats in the parliament. After the elections are done, the winners work together to find out who the [[prime minister]] should be, as well as who the other [[Minister (government)|ministers]] should be.  Here is a short summary of the biggest political parties in Norway, from left to right on the [[Politics#Left-wing and right-wing political parties|political axis]]:  * [[Red (Norway)|Red]] (Rdt): A [[revolutionary socialist]] party which works for equality of income, labour rights, a controlled economy and [[feminism]].  * [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]] (Sosialistisk venstreparti): The party is not very radical and is concerned with environmental issues as well as education. The party is traditionally regarded as the "teacher's party" because of their focus on learning and school. One might call SV more of a [[social democracy|social democratic]] party than a socialist party, since their socialist views have faded over the years. They were more radical in the 1970s and 80s.  * [[Norwegian Labour Party]] (Arbeiderpartiet): The Labour Party is the biggest party in Norway. They work for a strong economy with many regulations on private businesses, and are traditionally the party for workers, securing labour rights and the [[welfare state]].  * [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] (Senterpartiet): The Centre Party used to be known as the farmer's party; they no longer use this name, but still they are mostly popular in the countryside and other rural regions, since they work for the environment and protection of Norwegian farmers. For example, raising [[tariff]]s, or putting [[tax]]es on [[import]]s, to make foreign food cost more so that people will buy from Norwegian farmers. This is called [[protectionism]].  * [[Green party|Green Party]] (Miljpartiet de Grnne): The Green party works for the environment only, and has recently been gaining a lot of popularity for its radical politics. They are mostly a left-side party, but will switch sides if it helps the environment.  * [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] (Venstre): Even though it is called Left in English, it is actually a [[social liberal]] party that belongs to the centre-right side of Norwegian politics. They work for liberal rights like [[freedom of speech]], [[gender equality]] and they are also concerned with environment. Because of this they heavily support [[public transport]]. * Kristelig Folkeparti: The Christian People's Party is at present more active in local than national politics. * [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] (Hgre): The flagship of the right side of politics, it is a conservative party and is the second biggest party in Norway. It works for a [[free market]], liberal rights and equality of opportunity. They are friendly towards private businesses and support economic growth by making taxes smaller, so that more people can start businesses. * [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] (Fremskrittspartiet): The Progress Party is a right-side party. It works for stronger [[immigration|immigration laws]], a [[capitalism|free market]] and tough penalties for [[crime]]s. They also support private schools and [[tax|flat taxes]].  The Conservative Party and the Progress Party are currently working together in a [[coalition]] government, after getting elected in the 2013 elections. It's also a [[minority government]], so it has to work together with the other parties in the parliament to make change.  ==Largest cities== The city with the most people living there (or [[inhabitant]]s) is [[Oslo]]. The city of [[Bergen]] has 272,000 people living there; the city of [[Trondheim]] has 182,000 people in its [[population]].  Some claim that Bergen and Trondheim, each had their time as Norway's capital during the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>dead link{{cite web |url=http://www.trondheim.com/engelsk/touristinfo/ |title= Trondheim - the official website|access-date=2009-09-04 }}</ref>  == Organisations associated with the Government of Norway == * [[NATO]] : Norway was a founding member. * [[United Nations]]  ==Related pages== * [[List of rivers of Norway]] * [[Norway at the Olympics]] * [[Norway national football team]]  == Other websites == * [http://www.norway.no Norway.no]  Norway's official website * [http://www.visitnorway.com VisitNorway.com]  Official travel guide to Norway * [http://www.environment.no/Topics/Norway/ Environment.no] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813071911/http://www.environment.no/Topics/Norway/ |date=2011-08-13 }}  State of the environment in Norway  == References == {{reflist}}  {{Europe}} {{North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)}}  {{coord|60.38|N|5.34|E|display=title}}  [[Category:Norway| ]] [[Category:Nordic countries]] [[Category:Current monarchies]] [[Category:1945 establishments in Europe]]</text>
