<title>Jungle</title><text>[[File:Jungle.jpg|thumb|A Jungle]] The '''jungle''' is a place in a [[Rainforest|rain forest]] where the forest floor is crowded with plants. Like other rainy places, they have many rivers or streams. [[Scientist]]s think that more types of [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s live in the jungles than everywhere else. When people talk about jungles, they sometimes mean the whole [[rainforest]].  The crowding in a jungle leaves little room to walk. This may make it dangerous to people.
