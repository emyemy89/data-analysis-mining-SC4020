Marx thought that if a place that works together runs on [[worker|wage-labor]], then there would always be [[class struggle]]. Marx thought that this class struggle would result in workers taking power. He believed that no economic class''''wage workers, land owners, etc. should have power over another. Marx believed that everyone should [[To each according to his contribution|contribute what they can]], and everyone should get what they need. His most famous [[book]] was [[the Communist Manifesto]]. He wrote it with [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1848. The book is about the ideas and aims of [[communism]]. His ideas are called [[Marxism]].  His most important work is ''[[Das Kapital]]'', or The Capital. It is commonly known in English as simply 'Capital.' He spent many years working on the three parts of the book.  Das Kapital describes how "[[capitalism]]" works and the problems this creates, such as [[division of labour]], [[alienation]] and [[exploitation]].  The book has led to many arguments between those who agree with the book and those who do not. Marx's ideas have been thought of as responsible for [[socialist]] [[revolution]]s (like the [[Russian Revolution]]).  Marx's most popular [[theory]] was 'historical materialism', arguing that history is the result of material conditions, rather than ideas.  He believed that [[religion]], [[morality]], [[social structures]] and other things are all rooted in [[economics]].  In his later life he was more tolerant of religion.  Karl Marx was born in [[Trier]] in 1818,<ref>Blumenberg, Werner ''Karl Marx: An Illustrated History'' Verzo London 2000 page 4</ref> but he had to move many times because the government did not like his ideas. Marx lived for a long time in [[London]]. He died there in 1883.<ref>von Dehsen, Christian D. 1999 Lives and Legacies: An Encyclopedia of People who Changed the World: Philosophers and Religious Leaders Oryx Press 1999 page 127</ref> After he died, his friend Engels finished many of his works.  Marx also wrote the ''Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844'', a critique of political economy in which he discusses topics such as labor wages, labor rent, and capital profit, and his ideas of how to change the economy, including [[proletariat|proletarian]] socialist revolution and an eventual communist society.<ref>Marx, Karl;
