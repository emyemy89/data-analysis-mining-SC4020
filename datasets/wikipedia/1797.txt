[[Human]]s are the only [[animal]]s which wear clothing, and all people do wear suitable clothing.  The [[torso]] (body) can be covered by [[shirt]]s, [[arm]]s by sleeves, [[leg]]s by [[pants]] or [[skirt]]s, hands by [[glove]]s, feet by [[footwear]], and [[head]] by [[Hat|headgear]] or [[mask]]s.  In cold climates, people also wear heavy, thick [[coat]]s such as [[trenchcoat]]s.  Clothing protects the human body from the hot sun and high [[temperature]]s in warm [[tropics|tropical]] countries.  Clothing such as thick wool [[coat]]s and boots keeps the human body warm in very cold [[temperature]]s (such as in the [[arctic]]). To some extent, clothing protects people from damage to their body.  Clothing is also worn for decoration, as a [[fashion (clothing)]]. People from different [[culture]]s wear different clothing, and have different beliefs and customs about what type of clothing should be worn. For many people, clothing is a status symbol. It helps people project an image. Often, clothing is a form of self-expression. Adults in different social or work situations present different views of themselves by the clothes they wear. Young people have an entirely different form of dress to express their personalities. Often people will simply follow popular fashion styles so that they will fit in. Clothing is far more than just a means to protect our bodies.  ==Origin of clothing== There is no easy way to be sure when clothing was first developed, because it was [[Pre-history|prehistoric]] and clothing is perishable. Some information comes from studying [[lice]]. The [[body louse]] lives in clothing, and diverged from [[head lice]] about 107,000 years ago. This suggests that clothing existed at that time.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser & Mark Stoneking |journal=Current Biology |volume=13 |pages=14141417 |year=2003 |title=Molecular evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the origin of clothing |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00507-4 |pmid=12932325|issue=16}}</ref><ref name="Stoneking">{{cite web|url= http://www.current-biology.com/content/article/fulltext?uid=PIIS0960982204009856|last= Stoneking|first= Mark|title= Erratum: Molecular evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the origin of clothing|accessdate= March 24, 2008}}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/1/29.full "...Lice Indicates Early Clothing Use ..."], Mol Biol Evol (2011) 28 (1): 29-32.</ref> Another theory is that modern humans are the only survivors of several species of [[primate]]s who may have worn clothes,<ref>{{cite book |last=Reed |first=David |title=Pair of lice lost or parasites regained: The evolutionary history of Anthropoid primate lice |publisher=BMC Biology |year=2007 }}</ref>  and that clothing may have been used as long ago as 650 thousand years ago.  Other [[louse]]-based estimates put the introduction of clothing at around 42,00072,000 [[BC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/13258/naked_ape_humans_lost_body_hair_long_before_finding_clothes/|title=Naked ape: Humans lost body hair long before finding clothes|accessdate=2012-03-13|date=2003-08-20}}</ref>  A [[cloak]] made of the [[fur]] of [[squirrel]]s, from a cave in Italy, has been dated to 23.000 years BP, and is possibly among the oldest items of clothing.<ref>Art.

They might also go in for [[body modification]]: [[tattoo]]s, [[scarification]]s, and [[body piercing]]s. But makeup and tattoos are not kinds of clothing.  Things that are carried and not worn, like [[wallet]]s, [[purse]]s, [[cane]]s, and [[umbrella]]s, are called [[accessories]], but they are not kinds of clothing, either. [[Jewelry]] and [[eyeglasses]] are also accessories that are put on the body. [[Nail polish]] is also put on the fingertips and can be interpreted as makeup.  == What clothing is made of == Clothing is often made of: * [[Cloth]] **Natural fibres, such as [[cotton]], [[flax]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], [[ramie]], [[silk]]   **[[Synthetic fabric]], such as [[nylon]], [[polyester]], [[acrylic]]  * [[Fur]] * [[Leather]]  == Needed to make clothing == * [[Cloth]] * [[Scissors]] or [[knife|knives]]. * [[Needle]]s and [[thread]]. * [[Sewing machine]] or weaving wheel  == Related pages == * [[Fashion]] * [[Fashion design]] * [[Template:Human timeline|Human timeline]]  == References == {{Commons category|Clothing}} {{Reflist}}  [[Category:Clothing| ]]</text>
