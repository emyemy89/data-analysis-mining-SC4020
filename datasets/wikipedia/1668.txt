<title>Human penis</title><text>[[File: Unshaved flaccid penis.jpg|thumb|A flaccid, uncircumcised human penis]] The '''human penis''' is a [[male]] body part found on the outside of the body. It is used for [[urination]] and for [[sexual reproduction]]. The main sexual function of the penis is to be inserted into a [[female]]'s [[vagina]] and deliver [[semen]] which may cause [[pregnancy]]. This activity is called [[sexual intercourse]].  There are many [[slang]] words for ''penis''. They include ''dick'', ''cock'', and ''schlong''. A [[euphemism]] for ''penis'' is ''male member''.  == Structure == The human penis exits the abdomen above the [[testicle]]s and hangs freely outside the body. The main visible part is called the shaft.  The human penis is made up of three types of [[biological tissue|tissue]]. It has two [[corpora cavernosa]] (special pieces of [[muscle]]) next to each other and a [[Corpus_spongiosum_penis|corpus spongiosum]] (spongy muscle) between them.  The end of the corpus spongiosum forms the [[glans penis]] which is underneath the foreskin in uncircumcised males. The area on the bottom of the penis, where the foreskin is attached on uncircumcised men, is known as the [[frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenulum]]. The [[urethra]], the tube where [[urine]] and semen travel through, runs down the corpus spongiosum (spongy tissue), and opens at the tip of the penis. [[Sperm]] are made in the [[testes]] (ball-like organs) and stored in the [[epididymis]] (layer of tissue) around the testes. During ejaculation, sperm are pushed up the [[vas deferens]]. Fluids are added by the [[seminal vesicle]]s, the prostate gland and the [[bulbourethral gland]]s to make semen.  == In sexual reproduction ==  === Erection === [[File:Penis size from faccid to errect.jpg|thumb|An adult penis in different sizes from flaccid to erect]] {{main|Erection}} A penis can become [[erection|erect]] if a  male is sexually aroused (or sometimes during sleep, even though there is no sexual stimulation). In an erection, the penis fills with [[blood]]. The blood makes the penis become longer, thicker and harder. [[Vein]]s taking blood away from the penis get smaller, so less blood is taken through. [[Artery|Arteries]] bringing blood to the penis get wider, bringing more blood to the penis.  === Ejaculation === {{main|Ejaculation}} Ejaculation is when [[semen]] is pushed from the penis. It usually happens during an [[orgasm]]. Males can ejaculate during [[sexual intercourse]] or by [[masturbation]].  In reproductive sexual intercourse between a male and female, the erect penis is inserted into the [[vagina]] and moved in and out. The vagina places pressure on the penis, which can cause the male to have an orgasm and ejaculate into the vagina, causing insemination.     Other forms of sex, like anal and oral sex, can also cause stimulation, and therefore orgasm and ejaculation. In masturbation, a male can stimulate the penis and other sensitive areas of the body, such as the [[scrotum]], by rubbing the [[genital]] area. Ejaculation may also happen during [[sleep]] (called a '[[wet dream]]'). A male must have started [[puberty]] before he can ejaculate. During orgasm, [[muscle]]s push semen from the penis. Semen moves through the [[urethra]] and comes out of the hole at the tip of the penis.  == Penis size in humans == {{Main|Human penis size}} [[File:Human penis sizes.svg|thumb|Distribution of human penis sizes]] The [[length]] and [[girth|thickness]] of the penis is different for different people. The size of a soft penis (not erect) is much smaller than when it is erect. Some penises grow more when they get hard than other penises. In most cases, whether a penis is big or small, it can still be used for sex. It averages out to be around 3 to 6 inches long when not erect. The average size of an erect human penis is between 13  16 [[centimetre|cm]] (5.1 6 [[inch|in]]).<ref name="Wessells">{{cite web | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=8709382&dopt=Abstract | title = Penile length in the flaccid and erect states: guidelines for penile augmentation | accessdate = June 5, 2007 | author = Wessels, H | date = 1996 }}</ref><ref name="Chen">{{cite web | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=11416836&query_hl=2&itool=pubmed_docsum | title = Predicting penile size during erection | accessdate = 2006 | author = Chen, J | date = 2000-12-1 }}</ref><ref name="lifestyles_condoms">{{cite web | url = http://www.free-condom-stuff.com/education/research.htm | title = ANSELL RESEARCH - The Penis Size Survey | accessdate = 13 July 2006 | date = March 2001 | archive-date = 1 July 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060701200434/http://www.free-condom-stuff.com/education/research.htm | url-status = dead }}</ref> The average [[circumference]] of a penis is 12.3&nbsp;cm (4.85&nbsp;in) when fully erect.

Cutting off the foreskin is called [[circumcision]]. The foreskin is connected to the head of the penis. During circumcision, the foreskin is removed from the penis. Circumcision is usually performed on infant males for medical, religious or cultural reasons. Circumcision is common in some parts of the world, such as the [[United States]] and the [[Middle East]], but not common in some other parts of the world, such as [[Europe]] and [[China]].  Some males have the foreskin cut off when they are adults because they have problems with their foreskin. Some males have the foreskin cut off because they want to change how their penis looks.   In common speech, you can say that someone is ''cut'' or ''uncut'', meaning circumcised or not circumcised .   In some religions, babies and young boys have their foreskin cut off. This is expected in [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/circumcision.html | title = Circumcision | accessdate = August 3 | year = 2006 | publisher = American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise }} </ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia  | last = Beidelman  | first = T.  | editor = Mircea Eliade  | encyclopedia = The Encyclopedia of religion  | title = CIRCUMCISION  | url = http://www.male-initiation.net/anthropology/eliade.html  | accessdate = August 3  | year = 1987  | publisher = Macmillan Publishers  | volume = Volume 3  | location = New York  | isbn=978-0-02-909480-8  | pages = 511514 }}</ref> It is not required according to [[Christianity]]. In [[Judaism]], infant males are required to have their foreskin removed as a sign of the covenant (ancient promise) made with God.  ==Skin color== A young boy's penis skin is the same color as his other skin. Around age 12-15, a boy's penis skin gets slightly darker. This is normal because of [[puberty]]. This is caused by sex hormones (natural chemicals), especially [[testosterone]]. Testosterone makes more [[melanin]]. Melanin is the [[amino acid]] that causes skin color. (Sunlight also makes more melanin so skin gets a sun tan.) Usually a teenager or man's penis side skin is slightly darker than other skin on his body.<ref>{{cite web|title=Penises|url=http://teenhealthsource.com/puberty/penises/|website=http://teenhealthsource.com|publisher=Planned Parenthood Toronto|accessdate=18 March 2017|quote=Some penises are lighter in colour, some are darker  the colour of your penis is usually a bit darker than your overall skin colour.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ryan|first1=Lisa|title=Revealed... why your penis and nipples are darker than the rest of your skin: Sex hormones cause pigmentation in puberty - but 'darkening can be a sign of diabetes'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3390863/Revealed-penis-nipples-darker-rest-skin-Sex-hormones-trigger-pigmentation-puberty-sign-diabetes.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=18 March 2017|quote=A person's genitals are usually darker than the rest of their body}}</ref> The tip (glans) of the penis is usually pink or red color even if the penis side skin is dark. If the man is not circumcised, the tip is usually covered by the foreskin. The foreskin is about the same color as the skin on the side of the penis.  If a man's penis skin changes color and he doesn't know why, he should go to a doctor. He could have an [[infection]], [[diabetes]] or [[cancer]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ryan|first1=Lisa|title=Revealed... why your penis and nipples are darker than the rest of your skin: Sex hormones cause pigmentation in puberty - but 'darkening can be a sign of diabetes'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3390863/Revealed-penis-nipples-darker-rest-skin-Sex-hormones-trigger-pigmentation-puberty-sign-diabetes.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=18 March 2017|quote=further darkening in adulthood could be a sign of the chronic illness, diabetes}}</ref> A [[sunburn]] on the penis can happen quickly.  If a man is outside without clothes, he will get a sun tan. That is normal. Too much sun causes a sunburn. Doctors say to use [[sunscreen]] (sun cream) before and after [[Nudity#Common_activities_in_the_nude|nude swimming]]. A sunburn can happen in a few minutes on a very sunny day.  ==Culture== [[File:Penis tattoo - Genital tattooed like a canvas.jpg|thumb|Uncircumcised penis with a [[tattoo]]]] Since the oldest cultures the penis has assumed a strong importance as a symbol of fertility used also in religious ceremonies to propitiate the reproductive capacity of men and beasts. For example, in Roman paganism the god [[Priapus]] is characterized by a huge penis.  On the penis can be applied piercings and it can be tattooed as a body art form.  == Related pages == * [[Phallus]] * [[Scrotum]] * [[Testicles]] * [[Vagina]]  == References == {{reflist}}  == Other websites == {{commons|Penis}} * [http://www.indiana.edu/~kinsey/resources/bib-penis.html Kinsey Institute on the penis]   {{Reproductive system}}  [[Category:Anatomy of the male reproductive system]]</text>
