<title>Wikipedia:Standard messages</title><text>Sometimes when we work on a big writing project, we need to add the same sentences to many different pages. Writers sometimes use the [[jargon]] word <i>boilerplate</i> for sentences of this kind. You can find sentences to use here on this page and copy them to the page wher you need them.    == Copyright Violation ==  <nowiki>The text that was here might be someone else's copyright.

If you put the text here and you had permission to (see the [[Wikipedia:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License|license]]) then please say this on the [[Wikipedia:proposed deletions|]] page. If there was no permission then the page will be deleted after one week. People who keep on adding copyrighted text could be stopped from editing any more pages. We would still like you to help by adding original texts.
