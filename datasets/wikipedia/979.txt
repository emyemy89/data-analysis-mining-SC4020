the western part of the [[United States]]. It is the third largest US state by [[total area]] (after [[Alaska]] and [[Texas]]) with 163,696 sq mi (423,970 km<sup>2</sup>) and the largest by [[population]] with over 39 million people as of 2019. Its largest cities are [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], and [[San Francisco]]. The capital is [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. It is bordered by [[Arizona]] to the southeast, [[Oregon]] to the north, [[Nevada]] to the east and the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]] to the south.  California is the US state with the largest economy. California's [[Silicon Valley]] is home to some of the world's most valuable [[Technology company|technology companies]], including [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Alphabet Inc.]], and [[Facebook]].  What is now California was first settled by Native Californian tribes. Before that, it was explored by Europeans in the 16th and 17th century. It became the 31st state of the United States in 1850.  ==Geography== The geography of California varies depending on region. Southwestern California has small mountain ranges and the cities of San Diego and Los Angeles. Southeastern California has the Mojave Desert and [[Death Valley]], the lowest place in the United States. The eastern part of the state has the highest point in the United States outside of Alaska, [[Mount Whitney]], in the [[Sierra Nevada (US)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/ca_geography.htm |title=The Geography of California |website=NetState |date=January 5, 2014 |accessdate=July 13, 2014}}</ref>  The cities of Sacramento, [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], and [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] are in the [[Central Valley]]. The valley has the [[Sierra Nevada (US)|Sierra Nevada]] to the east and the Pacific Coast Ranges to the west. It is California's single most productive [[Agriculture|agricultural]] region and one of the most productive in the world. It produces more than half the fruit, vegetables, and nuts grown in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://naturalresources.house.gov/newsroom/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=368934 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-04 |archive-date=2016-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805200844/http://naturalresources.house.gov/newsroom/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=368934 |url-status=dead }}</ref> More than seven million acres (28,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of the valley are [[irrigation|irrigated]] by an extensive system of [[reservoirs]] and [[canals]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/federal-agencies-release-data-showing-california-central-valley-idle-farmland-doubling-during-drought/|title=Federal Agencies Release Data Showing California Central Valley Idle Farmland Doubling During Drought  Landsat Science}}{{Dead link|date=January 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  The west-central part of the state has some small mountains and the cities of San Francisco, San Jose, and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]].

[[Aerospace]] used to be a large industry there, but it has been downsized in the last 20 years.  There are many [[earthquake]]s in California. They happen when two tectonic plates (parts of the Earth's crust) shift underground. Californians need to be prepared for earthquakes and often store extra food, water, flashlights, and first aid supplies in case of such an emergency.  California has more people than any other state in the United States. If California was a separate country, it would have the sixth largest [[economics|economy]] in the world. California is probably the state with the most ethnic groups. It also has many different geographic features  mountains, deserts, and coasts. It is often called ''The Golden State''. The state flower is the golden poppy. The [[post office]] uses "CA" as a shorthand for California, and the [[Associated Press]] uses "Calif." or "Cali."  ==Politics== In 2019, [[Gavin Newsom]] became the [[governor]] of California. Before him, the governor was [[Jerry Brown]].  On November 4, 1992, [[Dianne Feinstein]] became one of California's United States [[United States Senate|senator]]s. On January 3, 2017, [[Kamala Harris]] became the other one.  In the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]], California U.S. Senator Harris was elected as the first woman and person of color to be [[Vice President of the United States]].  In January 2021, [[Alex Padilla]] became the next U.S. Senator, replacing Harris, and became the first [[Hispanic]] U.S. Senator from the state.  California was more conservative during the 1960s and 1980s when its former governor, [[Ronald Reagan]], ran for president as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. Today, California is more liberal and less conservative.  ==History==  The people in Coastal California were [[Native Americans]]. In the past, the area that was called "California" was not just today's California. This area covered the [[Mexico|Mexican]] lands south of it, as well as [[Nevada]], [[Utah]], and parts of Arizona and [[Wyoming]]. The Spanish called the part of the land that later became part of the United States ''Alta California'' (Upper California) when it was split from what became ''Baja California'' (Lower California). In these early times, the borders of the [[Sea of Cortez]] and the Pacific coast were not well known, so the old maps wrongly showed California to be an island. The name comes from ''Las sergas de Espladin'' (Adventures of Spladian), a 16th-century book by Garci Rodrguez de Montalvo, where there is an island paradise called California.  The first [[Europe]]an who visited parts of the coast, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, came from [[Portugal]] in 1542. The first European who saw the entire coast was Sir Francis Drake, in 1579, and he decided that the [[Great Britain|British]] owned it. But starting in the late 1700s, [[Spain|Spanish]] religious leaders of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] ("missionaries") got large gifts of land in the area north of Baja California, from the Spanish king and queen. These religious people set up small towns and villages, the famous California Missions. When Mexico was no longer controlled by Spain, the Mexican government took over the villages, and they soon became empty. [[File:Lightmatter sanfrancisco.jpg|thumb|[[San Francisco]], California|300px]] In 1846, as the [[Mexican-American War]] was starting, some Americans in California hoped to create a California [[Republic]]. These men flew a "Bear flag" that had a golden bear with a [[star]] on it. This Republic ended suddenly, however, when Commodore John D. Sloat of the United States [[Navy]] sailed into [[San Francisco Bay]]. He said that California was now part of the United States. After the war with Mexico ended, California was split between the two countries. The Mexican portion became the Mexican states of Baja California Norte (north) and Baja California Sur (south). ("Baja" means "lower" in Spanish.) The western part of the part given to the United States became today's state of California.  In 1848, there were about 4,000 Spanish-speaking people in today's California on the American side. (Today the state has a total of nearly 40,000,000 people.) In 1849, gold was suddenly found and the number of people went up very fast as the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] took hold. [[Slavery in the United States|Slavery]] also spread there as people hoping to find gold brought [[Black people|black]] slaves and either forced them to work in [[Gold mine|gold mines]] or hired them out for other work.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Anderson|first=Susan|date=2020-04-02|title=California, a "Free State" Sanctioned Slavery|url=https://californiahistoricalsociety.org/blog/california-a-free-state-sanctioned-slavery/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-15|website=California Historical Society|language=en-US}}</ref> In 1850, California became a state in the Union (the United States).  During the [[American Civil War]] (1861-1865), many people in California, especially in the southern part of California, thought the South was right and slavery should be protected. Some people in Southern California even wanted Southern California to leave the rest of the state and join the [[Confederate States of America]]. However, this did not happen. California joined the war to and helped the North (the Union) and sent many troops east to fight the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.drumbarracks.org/Original%20Website/California.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-08 |archive-date=2011-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410004023/http://www.drumbarracks.org/Original%20Website/California.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>  At first, travel between the far west and the east coast of the United States was dangerous and took a lot of time. Going by land was very difficult, because there were no roads and no trains, and many [[Native American]]s were attacking American people heading West in wagons. The only other way was to travel by boat around the [[Cape Horn]], at the southern end of [[South America]]. This took months, since the trip was thousands of miles long and the [[Panama Canal]] had not yet been built either. But in 1869, the connection got better quickly, because the first [[railroad]] across the continent was finished. Meanwhile, more people in California were learning that the land there was very good to grow fruit and other crops. [[Orange (fruit)|Oranges]] were grown in many parts of California. This was the beginning of the huge farming business that California has today.  ==Economy== The economy of the State of California is the largest in the United States. It has a [[gross state product]] (GSP) of US$3.2 trillion as of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gross Domestic Product by State, Fourth Quarter and Annual 2019|url=https://www.bea.gov/system/files/2020-04/qgdpstate0420.pdf|access-date=2019-07-01|website=www.bea.gov|publisher=US Department of Commerce, BEA ([[Bureau of Economic Analysis]])|language=EN-US}}</ref> It has many sectors. The most dominant are [[finance]], [[business services]], [[government]] and [[manufacturing]].

Today, California has more people than any other U.S. state. Starting in 1965, the variety of people became much greater as many different people from around the world came to the United States and often decided to live in California. California is thought to be a very [[Liberalism|liberal]] state, but there are still a lot of people who are [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and view [[Ronald Reagan]] as a hero. Technology is very advanced and many new cultural trends begin there. [[Engineering]] and [[computer]]s play a big part in the state's life. For over a hundred years, [[Movie|film]] has been one of the most important businesses in California. By the 1950s, [[television]] had also become an important business in California.  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==Other websites== {{Commons category|California}} {{California|expanded}} {{United States}} {{Colorado River system}}  [[Category:California| ]] [[Category:1850 establishments in the United States]]</text>
