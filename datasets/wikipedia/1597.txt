<title>Plane (mathematics)</title><text>:''Plane can also refer to [[airplane]].'' [[File:PlaneIntersection.png|thumb|Two intersecting planes in [[three-dimensional]] space]] A '''plane''' is a perfectly flat surface extending in all directions. It can be thought of as the ceiling of a room, only extended into all directions infinitely. A plane has two dimensions: [[length]] and [[width]]. All planes are flat surfaces. If a surface is not flat, it is called a ''[[curve]]d surface''.   The tool ''[[plane_(tool)|plane]]'' can be used to create a flat, level surface like the mathematical planehence the name.  In [[geometry]], a plane is made up of an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of [[line]]s (or [[point (geometry)|points]]). It has no [[depth]]. It is absolutely flat and infinitely large.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Introduction to plane geometry - Math Open Reference|url=https://www.mathopenref.com/planegeometry.html|access-date=2020-09-24|website=www.mathopenref.com}}</ref>  A ''plane figure'' is part of a plane. It is named by the capital letters (such as A, B, C, ...X, Y, Z) that are put at its [[corner]]s. Sometimes, a single capital [[pi]] <math>\Pi</math> is also used to refer to a plane.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2020-04-17|title=List of Geometry and Trigonometry Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/geometry-trigonometry-symbols/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-24|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}}</ref> A plane can also be named after three points that are not all on the same line.<ref>{{Cite web|title=An introduction to geometry (Geometry, Points, Lines, Planes and Angles)|url=https://www.mathplanet.com/education/geometry/points,-lines,-planes-and-angles/an-introduction-to-geometry|access-date=2020-09-24|website=Mathplanet|language=en}}</ref>  In general, two planes can be: * [[Parallel (geometry)|Parallel]] (they never meet) * Concurrent (they meet forming a line) * Coincident (they are one and the same)  == Plane in mathematics ==  In [[mathematics]], a '''plane''' is a fundamental [[two-dimensional]] object. Intuitively, it looks like a flat infinite sheet of paper. There are several definitions of the plane. They are equivalent in the sense of [[Euclidean geometry]], but they can be extended in different ways to define objects in other areas of [[mathematics]]. The only two-dimensional figure in our three-dimensional world is a [[shadow]].  In some areas of mathematics, such as [[plane geometry]] or 2D [[computer graphics]], the whole space in which the work is carried out is a single plane. In such situations, the definite article is used: ''the plane''. Many fundamental tasks in [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]] and graphing are performed in the two dimensional space, or in other words, in the plane.  == Euclidean geometry ==  	 A plane is a [[surface]] such that, given any three distinct [[point (mathematics)|points]] on the surface, the surface also contains all of the [[Line|straight lines]] that pass through any two of them. One can introduce a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] on a given plane in order to label every point on it with a unique ordered pair, which is composed of two numbers and is the coordinate of the point.  Within any [[Euclidean space]], a plane is uniquely determined by any of the following combinations:  * Three points which are not lying on the same [[line]] * A line and a point not on the line * Two different lines which intersect * Two different lines which are parallel * A [[vector]] [[normal]] to the plane and a distance from the [[origin]]  ==Related pages== * [[Point (geometry)]] * [[Line]]  == References == <references />  == Other websites == * [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Plane.html Mathworld: Plane] * [http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2850 Easing the Difficulty of Arithmetic and Planar Geometry] (work in Arabic, description in English)   {{math-stub}}  [[Category:Shapes]] [[Category:Geometry]]</text>
