The Macintosh was one of the first computers in which the people could use a mouse for pointing on a screen which had icons. This new way of working with a computer ([[interface]]) was known as [[graphical user interfaces and consoles|graphical user interface]]. It was this feature of the Macintosh that made it so popular.  == History == === Processor history === The '''AppleIntel transition''' was when Apple changed the [[CPU]] of Macintosh computers from [[PowerPC]] processors to Intel [[x86]] processors.<ref name="applepr">{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/06/06Apple-to-Use-Intel-Microprocessors-Beginning-in-2006.html|title=Press Info - Apple to Use Intel Microprocessors Beginning in 2006|date=2005-06-06|publisher=Apple|accessdate=2011-11-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/45176/2005/06/oranges.html|title=Apple faithful learning to like oranges|publisher=Macworld|accessdate=2011-11-01}}</ref>  It was announced at the 2005 [[World Wide Developers Conference]].<ref name="applepr" /><ref name="wired">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2005/06/67767?currentPage=all|title=Apple and Intel OK With Coders|author=Daniel Terdiman|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=2011-11-01}}</ref> [[Steve Jobs]] announced it.  Macintoshes were different than other personal computers for many years based on their [[central processor unit]] (CPU). At the start, Macs used [[Motorola 68000]] chips instead of [[Intel]] chips. Later, Macs used [[PowerPC]] chips. In 2006, Macs started to use Intel chips. Today, Macs are sold with Intel quad-core [[Intel Core i7|i7]] chips.  == Macintoshes == {| class="wikitable" |- |  || '''Compact''' (portable) || '''Consumer''' ([[wikt:end user|end user]]) || '''Professional''' |- | '''Desktop''' || [[Mac Mini]] || [[iMac]] || [[Mac Pro]] |- | '''Portable''' ([[MacBook]]) || [[MacBook]] || [[MacBook Air]] || [[MacBook Pro]] |- | '''Server''' || [[Mac Mini]] (server) ||  [[Mac Mini]] (server) || [[Mac Pro]] (server) |}  === Software === The Mac does not have the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system installed on it. It has its own range of operating systems, known as [[macOS]]. The newest operating system is known as Catalina".  Macs can run both Windows and macOS at the same time with help of a program called Boot Camp, which comes on every Mac.  In general, Macintosh computers cost more than other computers of the same speed.  ==Related pages== * [[iMac]] * [[MacBook]] * [[MacBook Air]] * [[MacBook Pro]]    * Other popular products of Apple include [[iPod]], [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]].  ==References== {{Commons|Apple Macintosh}} {{reflist}}   {{Tech-stub}}  [[Category:Computers]] [[Category:Apple hardware|Macintosh]]</text>
