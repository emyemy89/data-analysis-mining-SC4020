<title>Water cycle</title><text>[[File:Water cycle.png|thumb|right|300px|The water cycle]] The '''water cycle''' (or hydrological cycle) is the cycle that [[water]] goes through on [[Earth]].  Water is essential for life as we know it. It is present throughout the [[Solar System]], and was part of the Earth from its formation. The source of the water was the same as the source of the Earth's [[Rock (geology)|rock]] : the cloud particles which condensed in the [[origin of the solar system]].<ref name="Andel">Van Andel, Tjeerd H. 1994.

Evaporation means the sun heats the water which turns into a gas. * Then, water collects as [[water vapour]] in the sky.  This makes [[clouds]]. * Next, the water in the clouds gets cold. This makes it become [[liquid]] again. This process is called [[condensation]]. * Then, the water falls from the sky as rain, [[snow]], [[sleet]] or [[hail]]. This is called [[precipitation]]. * The water sinks into the surface and also collects into [[lake]]s, [[ocean]]s, or [[aquifer]]s. It evaporates again and continues the cycle.   ==Humans activities that affect the water cycle== Human activities that change the water cycle include: * [[Agriculture]] * [[Industry]] * Building [[Dam|dams]] * [[Deforestation]] * Removing [[groundwater]] from [[well]]s * [[Water extraction|Water abstraction]] from [[river]]s  == Related pages == * [[Carbon cycle]] * [[Rock cycle]] * [[Drought]] * [[Ecohydrology]] * [[Flood]] * [[Rain]] * [[Bioprecipitation]] ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **  == References == {{Reflist}}  [[Category:Water|cycle]] [[Category:Weather]] [[Category:Earth sciences]]</text>
