<title>Million</title><text>{{complex|date=February 2019}} '''One million''' (1,000,000), or one [[thousand]] thousand, is the natural number after 999,999 and before 1,000,001. The name is derived from Italian, where {{nobr|"''mille''"}} was 1,000, and 1,000,000 became a "''milione''", as 'a large thousand'.  In [[scientific notation]], the number is written as 110<sup>6</sup> or just 10<sup>6</sup>. Physical quantities can also be expressed using the [[SI]] prefix {{nobr|"mega-"}} when dealing with SI units. For example, 1 megawatt equals 1,000,000 watts.  The word 'million' is common to both the [[Long and short scales|short-scale and long-scale]] numbering systems, unlike the larger numbers, which have different names in the two systems.  The million is sometimes used in the English language as a [[metaphor]] for a very large number, as in 'Never in a million years' and 'You're one in a million', or as [[hyperbole]], as in 'I've walked a million miles'.  ''Il Milione'' is the title of [[Marco Polo]]'s narration of his travels in China. The name is supposed to come from Polo's nickname after his [[tales]] of riches and multitudes.  == Examples == * A [[millionaire]] is someone who owns at least one million units of [[currency]]. * In [[computer science]] a [[megabyte]] is about a million [[byte]]s, or 1,048,576 (1,024<sup>2</sup>). * In [[measurement]] there are a million [[millimeter]]s in a [[kilometer]].
