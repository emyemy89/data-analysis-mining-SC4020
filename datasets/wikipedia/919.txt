<title>Centripetal force</title><text>[[File:USSR_1979_5rubles_Ag_Olympics80_HammerThrow_(LMD)_a.jpg|thumb|Athlete must pull to make his [[hammer throw]] work properly]]  '''Centripetal force''' is an accelerating [[Force (physics)|force]] that acts on any body that revolves around a centre. This force contributes to keeping the body in [[rotation]]. This force is always directed towards the centre.  The opposite force (by [[Isaac Newton]]'s third law of motion) is called [[centrifugal force]]. This is the force that acts on the body in a direction away from the centre, which contributes to making the body try to fly away. When you hold a rope with a heavy object attached to it, and rotate it around, the rope becomes tight and keeps the body from flying away. This is caused by centripetal force.  An example is a [[roller coaster]] which uses centripetal force to accelerate the carts so they will keep going in a circular motion. Even if an object changes direction but maintains at a constant speed it still counts as [[acceleration]].  : <math>F_r = ma =m \frac{\omega r}{t} = m \frac{v^2}{r}</math>  ==Geometric proof for uniform circular motion== In the figure to the right we define the displacement [[vector]] <math>\vec s</math> to represent motion in a circle.  The magnitude of <math>\vec s</math> is denoted as <math>R\equiv ||\vec s||</math> and represents the radius of the particle's orbit.
