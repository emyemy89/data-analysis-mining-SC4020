A van can carry either [[goods]] or people. A van is usually bigger than the regular sized [[car]]. Panel vans (= vans whose cargo space has no side windows) are used for deliveries and carrying goods. These usually have large cargo space and few windows. A van which is used to carry people is often called a ''[[minibus]]''. It can usually carry many people, sometimes up to a total of 15.   Many companies make vans, including: [[Chevrolet]], [[Daihatsu]], [[Dodge]], [[Fiat]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[GMC]], [[Honda]], [[Hyundai]], [[Isuzu]], [[Mazda]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Mitsubishi]], [[Nissan]], [[Subaru]], [[Suzuki]], [[Toyota]], [[Vauxhall]], and [[Volkswagen]].  A minivan is smaller and usually carries up to seven people.  You may usually drive a van with the same [[driver's license]] as an ordinary car, but the heaviest and largest vans may require a [[truck]] licence.  The demand for minivans is dwindling due to the introduction of [[crossover]]s. However, some companies still make minivans. The most popular minivans are the [[Toyota Sienna]] and [[Honda Odyssey]].  ==Related pages== {{Commonscat|Vans}} * [[Ambulance]] * [[Pickup truck]] * [[Truck]]  {{Transport-stub}}  [[Category:Vans| ]]</text>
