It is important because much research has been done on its [[genetics]] and [[development]].  ''C. elegans'' is about 1 mm long. The worms are not [[parasite]]s, they are free-living. They live in soil and feed on [[bacteria]]. ''C. elegans'' is a [[model organism]], used to study [[animal]] [[development]] and behavior. It is the first [[multicellular organism]] for which [[scientist]]s have been able to sequence its whole [[genome]].  ''C. elegans'' has two types of sex: [[hermaphrodite]] and [[male]]. A hermaphrodite makes [[sperm]]s when its in a [[larva]]l stage and makes [[ovum|ova]] in an adult stage.  A male can only make [[sperm]]. Males are a little smaller than hermaphrodites.  Study using ''C. elegans'' was begun in 1965 by [[Sydney Brenner]]. In [[laboratory|laboratories]], they are easy to keep alive. At 25C, they spend 14 hours as an [[embryo]].  Animals like ''C. elegans'' that do not take long to grow and are easy to feed are usually good [[organism]]s for research.  In 2002, the [[Nobel Prize]] for [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Medicine]] was awarded to Sydney Brenner, [[Robert Horvitz]], and [[John Sulston]] for their work on how ''C. elegans's'' [[gene]]s cause it to grow and cause some of its [[cell]]s to die.  ==References== {{reflist}}  {{wikispecies|Caenorhabditis elegans}} {{Commonscat|Caenorhabditis elegans}} [[Category:Nematodes]] [[Category:Model organisms]]</text>
