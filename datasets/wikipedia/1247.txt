It is also spoken in [[Belgium]] ([[Wallonia]]), [[Luxembourg]], [[Quebec]] ([[Canada]]), [[Switzerland]] (Romandy) and many different countries in [[Africa]] (Francophone Africa). About 220 million people speak French as a [[first language|native]] or a [[second language]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/francophonie/francophones-monde.shtml "Les francophones dans le monde" (Francophones in the world")] Gives details from a report. {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/67Rdti6D1?url=http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/francophonie/francophones-monde.shtml |date=2012-05-05 }}</ref> It has also been one of the roots of other languages such as the [[Haitian Creole language]]. Like the other Romance languages, its [[noun]]s have genders that are divided into masculine (''masculin'') and feminine (''fminin'') words.  == History == In ancient times, the [[Celts]] lived in what is now France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celticattic.com/contact_us/the_celts/celts_facts_and_fiction.htm|title=Celtic History|accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref> In those days, the land was called [[Gaul]] ([[Latin]]: Gallia).  The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered Gallia and divided it into provinces.  Because the Romans spoke [[Latin]], the local people learned Latin and began to speak it. Their own language, Gaulish, tended to be spoken less often, although [[Breton language|Breton]] is a language still spoken today in the part of France called [[Brittany]], that came from the old Celtic language.  [[File:Francophone_Africa.svg|thumb|left| Francophone Africa]] French pronunciation, more so than other Romance languages, became radically different from Latin. After the [[Roman Empire]] fell and [[Germanic peoples]] swarmed the countryside, [[Vulgar Latin]] was changing quickly. In medieval France it changed into two [[dialect]]s or languages: ''langue d'oc'' and ''langue d'ol''. They both mean "language of yes", because ''oc'' was the word for "yes" in the south, and ''ol'' meant "yes" in the north.  Today, the word for yes in French is ''oui'', pronounced like "we".  In 1635, France established the [[Acadmie franaise|French Academy]] in order to standardize the French language. To this day, the academy establishes the rules for Standard French.  ''Langue d'oc'' is now called [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and it is still spoken by many people in Southern France.  == Letters == French uses the [[roman alphabet]], like English. There are a few differences, because vowels can have three types of [[diacritic]]s added on to them. These are the [[acute accent]] ''''''; [[grave accent]] '''''' and [[circumflex accent]] ''''''. A [[cedilla]] can also be added onto a '''c''' to make ''''''.  === Vowels === *'''a''' is pronounced like in "father". *'''ai''' and '''ei''' are pronounced like the "ay" in "say" *'''an''' and '''en''' are pronounced like the "on" in "wrong", though not if there are two '''n''' letters or an '''e''' directly after it. *'''au''' and '''eau''' are pronounced like the "o" in "note". *In the endings '''er''' and '''ez''', '''e''' is pronounced like the "ay" in "say". *'''eu''' is pronounced like the "e" in "verse". *Otherwise, '''e''' is like the a in "about". However, it is silent if it comes on the end of a word, unless it's a short word. *'''''' is pronounced like the "ay" in "say". *'''''' and '''''' are pronounced like the "e" in "bed". *Apart from '''e''', the three diacritics don't really affect how other vowels are pronounced. *'''i''' and '''y''' are pronounced like the "ee" in "tree". *'''in''' is pronounced like the "an" in "bank", though not if there are two '''n''' letters or an '''e''' directly after it. *'''o''' is pronounced like in "note". *'''oi''' is pronounced like a "w", following by the "a" in "father". *'''oin''' is pronounced like the "wan" in "twang". *'''on''' is pronounced like the "on" in "long", though not if there are two '''n''' letters or an '''e''' directly after it. *'''ou''' is pronounced like the "oo" in "food". *'''''' is pronounced like the "e" in "verse" but with more rounded lips. *'''u''' is not a sound that exists in English. It is pronounced like saying the "ee" in "feed", but with your lips rounded in the way that you would say the word "food". *'''un''' is pronounced like the "un" in "hung", though not if there are two ''n'' letters or an '''e''' directly after it.  === Consonants === *Like in English, '''c''' is pronounced as a "k" before most letters but as a soft "s" before '''e''', '''i''' or '''y'''. *'''''' is pronounced as a soft "s". *'''ch''', '''sh''' and '''sch''' are pronounced like the "sh" in "shop". *'''g''' is pronounced as a hard "g" before most letters. Before '''e''', '''i''' or '''y''', it is pronounced like the "s" in "treasure". *'''gn''' is pronounced like the "ny" in "canyon". *'''h''' is always silent. *'''j''' is pronounced like the "s" in "treasure". *'''l''' is normally (but not always) pronounced like the "y" in "yes" if it comes after the letter '''i'''; otherwise it is pronounced as an "l". *'''m''' and '''n''' change if they come after a vowel - see above. *'''qu''' is pronounced as a "k". *'''r''' is pronounced differently to English, being a gargling sound made at the back of your throat. *'''th''' is pronounced as a "t", not like in English. *'''x''' is pronounced "gz" or "ks". *'''b''', '''d''', '''f''', '''k''', '''p''', '''ph''', '''s''', '''t''', '''v''', '''w''' and '''z''' are pronounced the same as in English.  If a word ends with a consonant, this will usually not be pronounced unless the next word starts with a vowel. However, if the word is very short or the last consonant is a '''c''', '''r''', '''l''' or '''f''', this is still pronounced.  == Examples == [[File:10-07-2013 - Mary Robinson juge  inacceptables  les violences faites aux femmes en RDC - VOA.ogg|thumb|Spoken French]] Here are some examples of French words and sentences : {| class="wikitable" |- |'''Word'''       ||  '''Meaning''' |- |''Oui'' || Yes (''si'' when used as a reply to ''non'' or negative expressions) |- |''Non'' || No |- |''Bonjour'' || Hello (formal) |- |''Au revoir'' || Goodbye |- |''Salut'' || Hi and goodbye (informal) |- |''Merci'' || Thank you |- |''Merci beaucoup'' || Thank you very much |- |''Monsieur'' || Sir, mister |- |''Madame'' || Madam, Mrs. |- |''Homme'' || Man |- |''Femme'' || Woman |- |''Fille'' || Girl |- |''Garon''|| Boy |- |''Poulet'' || Chicken |- |''Formidable'' || Wonderful |- |''En vacances'' || On vacation/holiday |- |''Eau'' || Water |- |''Manger'' || To eat |- |''Parlez-vous franais?'' || Do you speak French? |- |''Je parle franais.'' || I speak French. |- |''Comment allez-vous?'' || How are you?

This is despite the fact that scholars consider English to be a [[Germanic language]] like [[German language|German]]. Words in different languages with the same meaning which are spelled similarly are called [[cognate]]s.  Most English words ending with "tion" and "sion" came from the French language.
