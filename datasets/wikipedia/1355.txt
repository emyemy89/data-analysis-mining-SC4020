''Infrastructure'' includes [[road]]s, [[railway]]s, [[airport]]s, [[canal]]s and [[pipeline]]s. The infrastructure is the [[network]] where things are carried. Infrastructure also includes [[airport]]s, [[railway station]]s, [[bus station]]s and [[seaport]]s (docks). Infrastructure is usually built by [[government]]s and paid for by [[tax]]es from the citizens of a country or region. Infrastructure such as roads and railways are designed by [[civil engineer]]s and [[urban planner]]s.  ''Vehicles'' or vessels travel on the infrastructure. Vehicles include [[car]]s, [[truck]]s, [[Railway|trains]] and [[airplane]]s. Vehicles are usually designed by [[mechanical engineer]]s. Vessels include [[boat]]s, [[ferry|ferries]], and [[barge]]s which travel on canals and use docks and seaports. In the same way that trains use train stations, [[airplane]]s use airports. In the same way that trains use railway lines (train tracks), [[airplane]]s use flight paths and then fly in the sky.<ref>Transport in Japan, [http://www.transport-pf.or.jp/english/sora/06_michi.html "There are paths even in the air"]; retrieved 2012-9-5.</ref>  ''Operations'' control the system. Operations include [[traffic signal]]s, [[railway signal]]s and [[air traffic control]]. Operations also include the government [[policy|policies]] (a policy is a plan of action to guide decisions and actions) and [[regulation]]s (a set or group of laws and rules) used to control the system, such as [[toll road|tolls]], [[fuel tax]]es, and [[traffic law]]s.  == Transport and communications == Transport and [[communication]] can be used instead of each other (someone could [[telephone]] a person rather than visit them). Transport [[traffic]] also needs communication.  For example, [[air traffic control]] lets more airplanes fly.  So, an increase of either transport or communication usually leads to an increase in the other one.   == Transport, energy, and the environment == Transport uses a lot of [[energy]]. Most transport uses [[hydrocarbon]]s ([[oil]] and [[gas]]). This can create [[pollution]]. [[Environmental regulation]]s (laws) and [[low-pollution fuel]]s (for example [[liquified natural gas]]) can reduce pollution. But as more vehicles are used, more pollution is created.  Ethanol and biodiesel pollute less than petroleum.  == Kinds of transportation ==  Transport can be by land, water or air: * [[Land transport]] using walking, [[road]]s and [[railway]] tracks <ref>Transport in Japan, [http://www.transport-pf.or.jp/english/riku/index.html "Land vehicles"]; retrieved 2012-9-5.</ref> by bicycles and other [[vehicle]]s * Water transport using [[ship]]s and  [[barge]]s in [[canal]]s and in [[river]]s and [[sea]]s <ref>Transport in Japan, [http://www.transport-pf.or.jp/english/umi/index.html  "Sea vehicles"]; retrieved 2012-9-5.</ref>  * Air transportation using airplanes and airports and helicopters<ref>Transport in Japan, [http://www.transport-pf.or.jp/english/sora/index.html  "Air vehicles"]; retrieved 2012-9-5.</ref>  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==Other websites== {{commons category-inline|Transport}} {{wikt}}   [[Category:Basic English 850 words]] [[Category:Transport| ]]</text>
