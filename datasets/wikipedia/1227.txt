<title>Phases of the Moon</title><text>{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2020}}   [[File:Moon Phase Diagram for Simple English Wikipedia.GIF|thumb|299x299px|alt=Diagram showing the Moon's phases.|Diagram of the Moon's phases: The Earth is at the center of the diagram and the Moon is shown orbiting (dashed circle). The Sun lights half of the Moon and Earth from the right-side. The phase of the Moon is shown next to the corresponding position of the Moon in its orbit around Earth. The phase is as seen in the [[Northern hemisphere]] of the Earth.]] The '''phases of the Moon''' are the different ways the [[Moon]] looks from [[Earth]] over about a [[month]].  As the Moon orbits around the Earth, the half of the Moon that faces the Sun will be lit up. The different shapes of the lit portion of the Moon that can be seen from Earth are known as phases of the Moon. Each phase repeats itself every 29.5 days.  The same half of the Moon always faces the Earth, because of [[tidal locking]]. So the phases will always occur over the same half of the Moon's surface.  A phase is an angle of the moon to the earth so it appears differently every day.  == Phases == [[File:Lunar_libration_with_phase2.gif|right|thumb|Animation of the moon phases]] The moon goes through 8 major phases. * A ''new moon'' is when the moon cannot be seen because we are looking at the unlit half of the Moon. The ''new moon'' phase occurs when the Moon is directly between  the Earth and Sun. A [[solar eclipse]] can only happen at new moon. * A ''waxing crescent moon'' is when the Moon looks like a crescent and the crescent increases ("waxes") in size from one day to the next. This phase is usually only seen in the west. * The ''first quarter moon'' (or a ''half moon'') is when half of the lit portion of the Moon is visible after the ''waxing crescent'' phase. It comes a week after new moon.  * A ''waxing gibbous moon'' occurs when more than half of the lit portion of the Moon can be seen and the shape increases ("waxes") in size from one day to the next. The ''waxing gibbous'' phase occurs between the first quarter and full moon phases.  * A ''[[full moon]]'' is when we can see the entire lit portion of the Moon. The ''full moon'' phase occurs when the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun, called [[Opposition (astronomy and astrology)|opposition]]. A [[lunar eclipse]] can only happen at full moon. * A ''waning gibbous moon'' occurs when more than half of the lit portion of the Moon can be seen and the shape decreases ("wanes") in size from one day to the next. The ''waning gibbous'' phase occurs between the full moon and third quarter phases.  * The ''last quarter moon'' (or a ''half moon'') is when half of the lit portion of the Moon is visible after the ''waning gibbous'' phase. * A ''waning crescent moon'' is when the Moon looks like a crescent and the crescent decreases ("wanes") in size from one day to the next.  == "Blue moon" == * A second full moon in one calendar month is usually called a "blue moon" and this occurs approximately every 3 years. The [[idiom]] "Once in a blue moon" refers to something that does not happen often (like a blue moon).<ref>However, a '''blue moon''' can also refer to the third full moon in a [[season]] with four full moons.</ref><ref name="SkyTel">{{cite web |last=Sinnott |first=Roger W., Donald W.

As Moon is exceptionally close to Earth; full Moon appears up to 7% larger and 15% brighter than a typical full moon. Traditionally any full moon that occurred in April was called a pink moon because it marked the blooming of Moss pink a wildflower.  ==Related pages== * [[Extraterrestrial sky]] * [[Earth phase|Phases of the Earth]] *[https://amazingfact.co/spacefacts/super-pink-moon-2020/ Super Pink Moon]  ==References== {{Reflist|2}}  [[Category:Moon]]</text>
