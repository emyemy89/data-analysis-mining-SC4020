It was founded to replace the [[League of Nations]] following [[World War II]] and to prevent another conflict. When it was founded, the UN had 51 Member States; there are now 193. Most [[nation]]s are members of the UN and send [[Diplomacy|diplomats]] to the headquarters to hold meetings and make decisions about [[global]] issues.   The goals of the United Nations are: * To keep [[world peace]]. * To help countries get along. * To [[right to an adequate standard of living|improve living conditions]] for people all over the world. * And to make the world a better place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/unintro/unintro2.htm |title=Introduction to the United Nations |publisher=United Nations |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=April 7, 2011 |archive-date=April 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410094048/http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/unintro/unintro2.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>  == History == After [[World War I]], the nations of the world formed the League of Nations. This organization was a place where nations could talk through their differences calmly. However, some countries like [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Japan]] ignored the League and tried to solve their problems through war. Members of the League of Nations did not want to go to war to protect other members and the League failed.  A Second World War soon started.  The [[Allies of World War II]] often called themselves "the United Nations" (united against the [[Axis Powers]]).  After the War, the winners formed a new organization for world peace. On 25th April 1945 in [[San Francisco]], they decided on the name '"United Nations". In June they signed the United Nations Charter saying how the organization would work. The UN was created on 24 October 1945 and its first meeting was held in January 1946. Since 1947 the 24th of October has been called United Nations Day. The only country whose flag is modelled after the United Nations is [[Somalia]].<ref>Tittemore, Brian D. "Belligerents in blue helmets: applying international humanitarian law to United Nations peace operations." Stan. J. Int'l L. 33 (1997): 61.</ref>  == Headquarters == All organs of the United Nations are based in [[New York City]], USA, except the [[International Court of Justice]] which is located at [[The Hague]] in the Netherlands.  ==Activity== The main building for the United Nations is in [[New York City]] in the [[United States|United States of America]], but the UN also has important offices in [[Geneva]] ([[Switzerland]]), [[Nairobi]] ([[Kenya]]) and [[Vienna]] ([[Austria]]). The UN tries to be peaceful, but sometimes when talks do not work the UN, unlike the League of Nations, will fight too. In the 1950s the UN helped [[Korean War|South Korea in a war against North Korea]], and in the 1990s the UN helped to force [[Gulf War|Iraqi soldiers out of Kuwait]]. At other times, the UN has formed 'peacekeeping' forces. UN peacekeepers travel to troubled places in the world and try - sometimes successfully, sometimes not - to keep the peace. Today there are UN peacekeepers working in [[Afghanistan]], [[Cyprus]], [[Haiti]], [[Liberia]] and several other countries. Through a series of goals, resolutions and declarations adopted by member nations of the United Nations, the world has a set of commitments, actions and goals to stop and reverse the spread of HIV and scale up towards universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services.  == Divisions == The United Nations has six "principal organs":  <div style="padding-top:15px; padding-bottom:15px; text-align:center">'''Principal organs of the United Nations''' <ref>[[:wikisource:Charter of the United Nations|Charter of the United Nations]] - [[:wikisource:Charter_of_the_United_Nations#Chapter_III_-_Organs|Chapter III]] (''Organs'')</ref></div> <div style="overflow-x:auto;"> {| cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" style="background:#E0E0E0; width:100%" |- style="text-align:center"  | width=34% style="padding-left:15px; padding-top:10px" | '''[[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]]'''<br/>- Deliberative assembly of all [[Member states of the United Nations|U.N. member states]] (each country has one vote) - | rowspan="7" style="background:white" | | width="34%" style="padding-left:15px; padding-top:10px" | '''[[United Nations Secretariat|UN Secretariat]]'''<br/>- Administrative organ of the U.N. - its chairman is the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary General]] - | rowspan="7" style="background:white" | | width=34% style="padding-left:15px; padding-top:10px" | '''[[International Court of Justice]]'''<br/>- Universal [[court]] for [[international law]] (based in [[The Hague]]) - |- style="text-align: center" | <div style="position:relative; height:120px; overflow:hidden"> <div style="position:relative; top:-30px; left:0px;"><div style="overflow-x:hidden; overflow:hidden; width:100%"> [[File:UN General Assembly hall.jpg|260px|UN General Assembly hall]]</div></div></div> | <div style="position:relative; height:120px; overflow:hidden"> <div style="position:relative; top:-47px; left:0px;"><div style="overflow-x:hidden; overflow:hidden; width:100%"> [[File:UN HQ 157652121 5b5979da9e2.jpg|260px|Headquarters of the UN in New York City]]</div></div></div> | <div style="position:relative; height:120px; overflow:hidden"> <div style="position:relative; top:-32px; left:0px;"><div style="overflow-x:hidden; overflow:hidden; width:100%"> [[File:International Court of Justice.jpg|260px|International Court of Justice]]</div></div></div> |- | valign="top" style="padding-left:15px; padding-bottom:10px"| * may resolve non-compulsory recommendations to states, or suggestions to the [[United Nations Security Council|U.N.S.C]].
