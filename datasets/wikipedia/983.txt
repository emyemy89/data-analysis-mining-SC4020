There are 3,847,400 people living in the city, and over 18 million people in the L.A. region. The city has an area of {{convert|1200|km2}}. Los Angeles is the city with the second biggest population in the [[United States]] after [[New York City|New York]], overtaking [[Chicago]] in the 1970s. It is also the biggest city of California. Due to being built on a [[fault line]], which runs through the [[downtown]], it is has few skyscrapers and tall structures and is one of the most spread out cities in the world. Greater Los Angeles is home to many of the biggest rock bands in the history of the United States. Los Angeles is surrounded by East Los Angeles, Huntington Park, Maywood, Walnut Park, Commerce, Bell, Glendale, South Pasadena, Monterey Park, South Gate, Cudahy, West Hollywood, Alhambra, Bell Gardena and Westmont.<ref> https://www.travelmath.com/cities-near/Los+Angeles,+CA</ref>  == History ==  The area comprising present-day Los Angeles County was first settled by small groups of [[Native Americans]] for centuries before the first European contact in 1769 when Gaspar de Portola and a group of missionaries camped on what is now the banks of the Los Angeles River. The name Los Angeles comes from the [[Spanish language]],and it means "The Angels". The name is an [[abbreviation]] from the original name of the place. The original name is "El Pueblo de Nuestra Seora la Reina de los ngeles del Ro Porcincula" (in [[English language|English]], "town of our lady the Queen of Angels of the River Porcincula"), giving it both one of the longest and shortest (referring to its shortening of "LA") place names in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-mar-26-me-name26-story.html|title=City of Angels First Name Still Bedevils Historians|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|date=March 26, 2005|accessdate=June 26, 2020}}</ref> Los Angeles was founded in [[1781]] while the area was within the borders of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. The area had earlier been explored by two [[Franciscan]] [[priests]] named [[Junipero Serra]] and [[Juan Crespi]] and following the [[Mexican War of Independence]] the region passed into the hands of [[Mexico]] which subsequently ceded control of California to the U.S. in 1848. On [[April 4]], [[1850]] California became a State of the USA. Los Angeles began half a century of rapid growth after [[railroads]] arrived in the city in the 1870s. Los Angeles was home to the [[Olympic Games]] in 1932 and 1984. It will host the Olympic Games in 2028. Three times the city broke out in riots, in [[Zoot Suit Riots|1943]], in [[Watts Riots|1965]], and in [[1992 Los Angeles riots|1992]], all due to [[racism]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zoot Suit Riots {{!}} Summary, Causes, Significance, & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Zoot-Suit-Riots|access-date=2020-11-18|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Szymanski|first=Michael|date=1990-08-05|title=How Legacy of the Watts Riot Consumed, Ruined Man's Life|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1990-08-05-9008031131-story.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-18|website=Orlando Sentinel|language=en-US}}</ref> In 1994, an [[earthquake]] killed 72 people and damaged many buildings.  == Geography == Los Angeles is a very large city, and the edges of the city are very far from the center, going from the beaches to the mountains. The [[Santa Monica Mountains]] run through the city, separating it into the [[San Fernando Valley]] to the north and the [[Los Angeles Basin]] to the south. The [[Los Angeles River]] also runs through the city some {{convert|51|mi|km}}. Los Angeles moves about one-quarter of an inch (6.3&nbsp;millimeters) to the east every year.<ref name="LATD">{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/24581456/ns/today-today_books/t/frey-crafts-new-view-modern-day-los-angeles/#.UpZeQE7nbIU|title=Frey crafts a new view of modern-day Los Angeles|publisher=Today.com|accessdate=November 27, 2013}}</ref> It is caused by the city's tectonic plates and rough ground geography and since Los Angeles is at a close distance with the [[San Andreas Fault]]. This brings Los Angeles and [[San Francisco]] 2.5 inches closer together each year.  === Climate === [[File:Hollywood sign.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|Hollywood sign]] The [[climate]] in Los Angeles is a [[Mediterranean climate]]. The weather is usually warm and dry during the summer, and it is mild and more rainy in the winter. The weather is different depending on how far away from the ocean you are, so places near the beach usually do not get as hot in the summer. It is very rare for temperatures to go below freezing. The city receives about 15&nbsp;inches (386&nbsp;mm) of rain each year, although the amount can change a lot from year to year.  == Sights == L.A. has many famous sights. There are many very long [[beach]]es, such as [[Venice Beach]]. Many visitors go to [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], home to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]  the Mann's (Grauman's) Chinese Theater, a large [[cinema]] and L.A. Live, an entertainment complex.  Los Angeles also has many fine museums such as the L.A. County Museum of Art, [[California Science Center]] and the [[Getty Museum]]. Another sight is the [[Los Angeles City Zoo]]. Los Angeles is the only major city in the world with an active population of wild mountain lions.<ref name="LATD"/>  == Industries == Los Angeles is known for its large [[movie]] and [[television]] [[industry]]. Much of this is located in Hollywood. Some [[military]] [[aircraft]] are also made there, as well as spacecraft.  The [[music]] industry is also concentrated in the area.  The city is also a [[banking]] center. The San Pedro area has a busy [[port]].  ==Neighborhoods== [[File:Los Angeles City Hall with sister cities.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|Los Angeles City Hall]]  Los Angeles has dozens of neighborhoods and named areas, including:  * [[Hollywood]], home of many well-known [[movie]] studios. * Downtown Los Angeles, the financial centre of the city.

Many of the most notable recording artists in the history of the United States either started or flourished in Los Angeles or Greater Los Angeles.  The surf music scene is largely associated with Los Angeles and suburbs like Malibu.  Motown Records moved from Detroit, Michigan to Los Angeles in the 1970s.  The West Coast Hip-hop scene and genres such as G-funk are largely centered in Greater Los Angeles.  Notable bands include: *[[The Beach Boys]] *[[The Doors]] *[[The Mamas & the Papas]] *[[Metallica]] *[[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] *[[The Eagles|Eagles]] *[[Guns 'n' Roses]] *[[The Byrds]] *[[Love (band)|Love]] *[[2Pac]] *[[Spirit (band)|Spirit]] *[[Rage Against the Machine]] *[[Buffalo Springfield]] *[[Beck]] *[[The Offspring]] *[[Tool (band)|Tool]] *[[No Doubt]] *[[System of a Down]] *[[Linkin Park]] *[[X (band)|X]] *[[N.W.A.]] *[[Dr. Dre]] *[[Ice Cube]] *[[Snoop Dogg]] *[[Jane's Addiction]] *[[Sublime]] (nearby Long Beach) *[[Steppenwolf]] *[[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] *[[Sugar Ray]] *[[The Wallflowers]] *[[Black Flag]] *Billie [[Billie Eilish|Eilish]]  ==Media==  [[KCBS]] [[CBS]]  [[KABC]] [[American Broadcasting Company]]  [[KTLA]] [[The CW]]  [[KTTV]] [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]  [[KCOP]] [[My13]]  ==References== {{reflist}} {{Commonscat|Los Angeles}}  {{USLargestCities}} {{Greater Los Angeles Area}} {{San Fernando Valley}} {{Los Angeles County, California}} {{California county seats}} {{California}} {{authority control}} [[Category:Los Angeles| ]] [[Category:County seats in California]] [[Category:Olympic cities]] [[Category:1781 establishments in North America]] [[Category:18th-century establishments in California]]</text>
