<title>Asia</title><text>[[File:LocationAsia.png|thumb|250px|[[World]] [[map]] showing where Asia is]] '''Asia''' is the largest [[continent]] on [[Earth]]. It is in the [[north]]ern [[hemisphere]]. Asia is connected to [[Europe]] in the west (creating a supercontinent called [[Eurasia]]). Some of the oldest human [[civilization]]s began in Asia, such as [[Sumer]], [[China]], and [[India]]. Asia was also home to some large empires such as the [[Persian Empire]], the [[Mughal Empire]], the [[Mongol Empire]], and the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming Empire]]. It is home to at least 44 countries. Turkey, Russia, Georgia and Cyprus are partly in other continents.   == Area == [[File:Two-point-equidistant-asia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Geography|Geographic]] area of ''Asia'']] The Asian continent is the largest of all continents. Covering about 30% of the world's land area, it has more people than any other continent, with about 60% of the world's total [[population]]. Stretching from the icy [[Arctic]] in the north to the hot and steamy equatorial lands in the south, Asia contains huge, empty [[desert]]s, as well as some of the world's highest mountains and longest rivers.   Asia is surrounded by the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Arctic Ocean]], the [[Pacific Ocean]], and the [[Indian Ocean]]. It is separated from Europe by the [[Pontic Mountains]] and the [[Turkish Straits]]. A long, mainly land [[border]] in the west separates Europe and Asia. This line runs North-South down the [[Ural Mountains]] in Russia, along the [[Ural River]] to the [[Caspian Sea]], and through the [[Caucasus Mountains]] to the Black Sea.  == Transcontinental countries == Some countries are variously located in both Europe and Asia. Namely: [[Russia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Turkey]].  The [[Sinai Peninsula]] of [[Egypt]]  lies in [[Western Asia]], with the rest of the country lying in North-East [[Africa]].  == List of Asian Countries == *{{flag|Afghanistan}} *{{flag|Armenia}}  *{{flag|Azerbaijan}}  *{{flag|Bahrain}} *{{flag|Bangladesh}} *{{flag|Bhutan}} *{{flag|Brunei}} *{{flag|Cambodia}} *{{flag|China}} *{{flag|Cyprus}} ''Note: part Europe'' *{{flag|Egypt}} ''Only Sinai Peninsula'' *{{flag|Georgia}} ''Note: part Europe'' *{{flag|India}} *{{flag|Indonesia}} *{{flag|Iran}} *{{flag|Iraq}} *{{flag|Israel}} *{{flag|Japan}} *{{flag|Jordan}} *{{flag|Kazakhstan}} ''Note: part Europe'' *{{flag|Kuwait}} *{{flag|Kyrgyzstan}} *{{flag|Laos}} *{{flag|Lebanon}} *{{flag|Malaysia}} *{{flag|Maldives}} *{{flag|Mongolia}} *{{flag|Myanmar}} *{{flag|Nepal}} *{{flag|North Korea}} *{{flag|Oman}} *{{flag|Pakistan}} *{{flag|Philippines}} *{{flag|Qatar}} *{{flag|Russia}} ''Note: part Europe'' *{{flag|Saudi Arabia}} *{{flag|Singapore}} *{{flag|South Korea}} *{{flag|Sri Lanka}} *{{flag|Syria}} *{{flag|Taiwan}} *{{flag|Tajikistan}} *{{flag|Thailand}} *{{flag|Turkey}} ''Note: Part Europe'' *{{flag|Turkmenistan}} *{{flag|United Arab Emirates}} *{{flag|Uzbekistan}} *{{flag|Vietnam}} *{{flag|Yemen}}  ==Related pages== {{commons}} * [[Asia Minor]] * [[Asian Games]] * [[Southeast Asia]]  {{Continent}} {{Asia}}  [[Category:Asia| ]]</text>
