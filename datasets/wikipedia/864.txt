It is used for [[radio astronomy]].  Stars shine and the light can be seen with an ordinary [[telescope]], but they also give off [[radio wave]]s.  [[Scientist]]s with radio telescopes receive these radio waves and use [[computer]]s to learn about the stars. Other things like [[black hole]]s also give off radio waves and radio telescopes are useful for learning about them too.  The dish is sometimes constructed of a [[conductive]] wire mesh whose openings are smaller than a wavelength. The information received by several radio telescopes in different places can be combined. This gives similar results to having a single dish as big as the distance between the telescopes. It can receive very faint signals, and see more details. The biggest telescope is a virtual radio telescope almost as big as the Earth, called the Event Horizon Telescope.  The radio telescope at the [[Parkes Observatory]], [[Parkes, New South Wales]] was used by [[NASA]] to receive messages from the [[Apollo 11]] moon landings.  == Related pages == * [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]]  {{tech-stub}}  [[Category:Telescopes]]</text>
