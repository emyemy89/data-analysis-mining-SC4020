<title>Drainage basin</title><text>'''Drainage basin''' is a [[geography|geographic]] term about [[river]]s.  It is also called  '''catchment''', '''catchment area''', '''catchment basin''', '''drainage area''', '''river basin''', and '''water basin'''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=David|authorlink=|title=The Field Guide to Geology|url=https://archive.org/details/fieldguidetogeol00lamb_0|publisher=Checkmark Books|series=|year=1998| pages=[https://archive.org/details/fieldguidetogeol00lamb_0/page/130 130]13|doi=|isbn=0-8160-3823-6}}</ref>  It is an area of land.  All water that falls on that land flows into one river. It can flow directly into the river or go through [[tributary|tributaries]] (smaller rivers that flow into the bigger river) first.    One river can drain a large area. For example, more than half of the [[United States]] is drained by the Mississippi and its tributaries. The [[Amazon basin]] is similarly large.  River basins are an open system with inputs and, outputs. Water comes in as [[precipitation]] and goes out as [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]].  == Watershed == This term can have two main meanings: * Meaning drainage divide, the line that separates neighbouring drainage basins * Meaning drainage basin in North American usage. (an area of land where surface water converges) There are also a number of figurative meanings as a [[metaphor]].  == Related pages == * [[Basin (geology)]] * [[Endorheic basin]]  == References == {{reflist}}   {{geo-stub}}  [[Category:Drainage basins| ]]</text>
