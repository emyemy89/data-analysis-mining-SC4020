<title>Election</title><text>[[File:Wahlen 2.jpg|thumb|370x370px|Today, an election in [[Germany]] is picking one of several options (or candidates). The notice tells voters to "fold each ballot paper several times and hand it in separately".]] [[File:Wahlen 3.jpg|thumb|369x369px|Each folded paper is dropped into a box.]]  An '''election''' is a way people can choose their [[candidate]] or their preferences in a [[representative democracy]] or other form of government.   Most [[democracy|democratic]] countries hold new elections for their national [[legislature]] every few years. What elections do is select representatives for the local areas. These are called MPs (Members of Parliament) in the British [[parliamentary system]]. Parliamentary systems may have a head of government and a head of state, but sometimes the two posts are held by the same person.  The legislature chooses the government, usually by majority vote in the legislature. Some democracies elect a [[president]], who then selects the government. Many democratic countries also have regional, provincial or state elections.  There are different ways to organize an election in different countries. Voters might vote for an individual, or they might vote for a political [[Political party|party]] ([[party list]]). This is because different countries use different [[voting systems]].  Countries that are not democracies can also hold elections. This is usually done to let the people choose a local representative (like a [[mayor]]). Also many countries call themselves democracies, but behind the scenes have a more autocratic form of [[government]].   Elections keep a [[democratic]] country functioning, as they give people the right to select their own government. However, there are ways a government can "fix" elections. Opposition candidates are permitted in former [[USSR]] countries, but they are usually prevented from using broadcasting or the newspapers. This means that, in effect, the ruling president is never challenged. Elections which are fixed are sometimes called sham elections or show elections.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kim-jong-un-wins-100-of-the-vote-in-north-korean-elections-9180814.html | title=Kim Jong-un wins 100% of the vote in his constituency| date=10 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2012/02/21/world/meast/yemen-elections/index.html|title=Yemen holds presidential election with one candidate|first=Mohammed |last=Jamjoom|website=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/29/egyptian-opposition-calls-boycott-elections-challengers-arrested/|title=Egyptian opposition calls for boycott of elections after challengers are arrested and attacked|first1=Raf|last1=Sanchez|first2=Magdy|last2=Samaan|date=29 January 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref name="urlAlexei Navalny latest: Russian opposition leader arrested ahead of presidential election | The Independent">{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/alexei-navalny-latest-updates-russia-president-election-opposition-leader-putin-protests-a8222956.html |title=Alexei Navalny latest: Russian opposition leader arrested ahead of presidential election &#124; The Independent |website= |accessdate=|date=22 February 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764407,00.html|title=RUSSIA: Justice in The Baltic|date=1940-08-19|work=Time|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref><ref name="urlYes, There Are Elections in North Korea and Heres How They Work - The Atlantic">{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/03/north-korea-elections-guide/358875/ |title=Yes, There Are Elections in North Korea and Here's How They Work - The Atlantic |format= |website= |accessdate=|date=6 March 2014 }}</ref>  [[Psephology]] is the study of elections.  == References == {{reflist}}   [[Category:Elections| ]] [[Category:Voting systems]]</text>
