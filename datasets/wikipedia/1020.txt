Their home stadium is [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] in Fulham, [[London]].  Chelsea is [[wikt:Consider|considered]] to be one of the most successful clubs of England, having won many trophies, including 6 Premier League, 1 [[UEFA Champions League]], 2 [[UEFA Europa League]], 5 [[EFL Cup|League Cup]], 8 [[FA Cup]], 1 [[UEFA Super Cup]] and 2 [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] titles. Their all-time highest goalscorer is [[Frank Lampard]] and their most successful goalkeeper (on the basis of clean sheets and titles statistics) is [[Petr ech]]. Chelsea is owned by the [[Russia]]n [[billionaire]] businessman [[Roman Abramovich]].  == History == Chelsea started in 1905 and played the second division of the league. They won their first trophy in 1955, when they became Champions of the First Division. They won the [[FA Cup]] in 1970, 1997, 2000 and 2007. They won the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] in 1965, 1998, 2005 and 2007. In 1970s Chelsea failed to maintain their position of the first division, due to the financial difficulties. In 1990s they challenged the title of Premier League. They came close but did not win it until 2005 and 2006.  In 2003 the Russian billionaire, [[Roman Abramovich]], purchased Chelsea and invested lots of capital to employ new football players. He also employed [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]], as the manager of the club. Abramovich also employed Peter Kenyon as the chief executive to be responsible for the commercial strategies of the club. This made Chelsea more and more powerful, and they won the [[English Premier League|Premier League]] in consecutive years. A third straight FA Premier League title slipped through Chelsea's fingertips after their failure to defeat Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium meant that Manchester United had won their ninth league title in fifteen tries.  On September 20, 2007, the very successful manager [[Jos Mourinho]] left the club by "mutual consent". This exit came just days after a shockingly poor performance which saw them barely scrape out a 1-1 draw in a [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] tie against Norwegian side [[Rosenborg B.K.]]. Following Mourinho's exit, Chelsea made Director of Football [[Avram Grant]], the former manager of Israel from [[2002]] to [[2006]], the new manager of the club, until [[May]] [[2008]]. Grant took over with Chelsea trailing in the [[English Premier League|Premier League]] "title race" behind [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], and managed to keep Chelsea in the hunt for the league until the last game of the season. He got Chelsea into the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League Final]] for the first time as well as the [[Carling Cup Final]], but he was sacked at the end of the season, along with assistant [[Henk ten Cate]]. Grant was sacked from the job after he lost in the final in a 5-6 [[penalty shootout]] loss to Manchester United and replaced by [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]], the then-Portugal coach, in August. However, after a poor run of results Scolari was sacked on [[February 9]], [[2009]]. Guus Hiddink took over the club until the rest of the season. In early June they played in the FA Cup final against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]],<ref>http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_4908061,00.html</ref> where Chelsea won 2-1, after [[Frank Lampard]] and [[Didier Drogba]] scored goals. In that final, [[Louis Saha]] of Everton scored the fastest goal in FA Cup history, in 25 seconds. A week later, the former [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] manager [[Carlo Ancelotti]] was named as the new manager of Chelsea. [[Antonio Conte]] was their manager until July 2018 and helped them win the 2016/17 league title. Frank Lampard, former Chelsea player, is Chelsea F.C.'s, current manager.  == League position == {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left;" |align="center"|Season||align="center"|League||align="center"|Position |- |200001||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||6th |- |200102||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||6th |- |200203||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||4th |- |200304||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||2nd |- |200405||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||Champions |- |200506||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||Champions |- |200607||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||2nd |- |200708||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||2nd |- |200809||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||3rd |- |200910||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||Champions |- |201011||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||2nd |- |201112||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||6th |- |201213||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||3rd |- |201314||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||3rd |- |201415||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||Champions |- |201516||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||10th |- |201617||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||Champions |- |201718||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||5th |- |2018-19||[[English Premier League|Premier League]]||3rd |- |2019-20 |[[Premier League]] |4th |}  === Former position === {{scroll box|width=75%| * 1905/06 : [[Football League One|Second Division]] -
