<title>Pi</title><text>{{about|the number|the Greek letter|Pi (letter)}} [[File:PI constant.svg|thumb|right|Pi is an endless string of numbers]] The number '''{{pi}}''' ({{IPAc-en|p|a}}) is a [[mathematical constant]] that is the [[ratio]] of a [[circle]]'s [[circumference]] to its [[diameter]]. This produces a number, and that number is always the same. However, the number is rather strange. The number starts as 3.141592653589793... and continues without end. Numbers like this are called [[Irrational number|irrational]] numbers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/|title=Compendium of Mathematical Symbols|date=2020-03-01|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2020-08-10}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/pi.html|title=Pi|website=www.mathsisfun.com|access-date=2020-08-10}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Pi.html|title=Pi|last=Weisstein|first=Eric W.|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2020-08-10}}</ref>  The diameter is the largest chord which can be fitted inside a circle. It passes through the center of the circle. The distance around a circle is known as the [[circumference]]. Even though the diameter and circumference are different for different circles, the number pi remains constant: its value never changes. This is because the relationship between the circumference and diameter is always the same.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Berggren| first1 = Lennart| last2 = Borwein| first2 = Jonathan M.| last3 = Borwein| first3 = Peter B.| title = Pi, a Sourcebook| year = 2000| publisher = Springer Verlag| isbn = 978-0-387-98946-4 }}</ref>  ==Fundamentals== ===Definition=== [[File:Pi eq C over d.svg|alt=A diagram of a circle, with the width labeled as diameter, and the perimeter labeled as circumference|thumb|right|The circumference of a circle is slightly more than three times as long as its diameter.

Pi is also an [[irrational number]], meaning it cannot be written as a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] (<math>a \over b</math>), where 'a' and 'b' are [[integer]]s (whole numbers).<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":1" /> This basically means that the digits of pi that are to the right of the [[decimal]] go [[Infinity|forever]]without repeating in a pattern, and that it is impossible to write the exact value of pi as a number.

[[Civilizations]] as old as the [[Babylonia]]ns have been able to approximate pi to many digits, such as the fraction 25/8 and 256/81.

''A History of Pi''. St. Martins Press, London.</ref> Around 1650 {{Smallcaps all|BC}}, the Egyptian Ahmes gave a value in the ''Rhind Papyrus''. The Babylonians were able to find that the value of pi was slightly [[greater than]] 3, by simply making a big circle and then sticking a piece of rope onto the circumference and the diameter, taking note of their distances, and then dividing the circumference by the diameter.  Knowledge of the number pi passed back into [[Europe]] and into the hands of the [[Hebrews]], who made the number important in a section of the [[Bible]] called the [[Old Testament]]. After this, the most common way of trying to find pi was to [[wikt:inscribe|draw]] a shape of many sides inside any circle, and use the [[area]] of the [[polygon|shape]] to find pi. The Greek philosopher [[Archimedes]], for example, used a [[polygon]] shape that had 96 sides in order to find the value of pi, but the Chinese in 500 {{Smallcaps all|ce}} were able to use a polygon with 16,384 sides to find the value of pi. The Greeks, like [[Anaxagoras]] of Clazomenae, were also busy with finding out other properties of the circle, such as how to make squares of circles and squaring the number pi. Since then, many people have been trying to find out more and more exact values of pi.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Pi_through_the_ages.html |title=Pi History |accessdate=2010-06-05 |author= J.J.

The first use of the Greek symbol "" was in an essay written in 1706 by William Jones.  A [[mathematician]] named Lambert also [[proved|showed]] in 1761 that the number pi was [[irrational number|irrational]]; that is, it cannot be written as a fraction by normal standards. Another mathematician named Lindeman was also able to show in 1882 that pi was part of the group of numbers known as [[transcendentals]], which are numbers that cannot be the solution to a [[polynomial]] equation.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.math.com/tables/constants/pi.htm |title=PI |accessdate=2010-06-06 |date=2000-2005 }}</ref>  Pi can also be used for figuring out many other things beside circles.<ref name=unleashed/> The properties of pi have allowed it to be used in many other areas of math besides [[geometry]], the study of shapes. Some of these areas are [[complex analysis]], [[trigonometry]], and [[Series (mathematics)|series]].  == Pi in real life == Today, there are different ways to calculate many digits of . This is of limited use though.  Pi can sometimes be used to work out the area or the circumference of any circle. To find the circumference of a circle, use the formula C ([[circumference]]) =   ([[diameter|diameter)]]. To find the area of a circle, use the formula  ([[radius]]). This formula is sometimes written as <math>A = \pi r^2</math>, where ''r'' is the [[variable]] for the radius of any circle and ''A'' is the variable for the area of that circle.  To calculate the circumference of a circle with an error of 1&nbsp;mm: * 4 digits are needed for a radius of 30&nbsp;meters * 10 digits for a radius equal to that of the earth * 15 digits for a radius equal to the distance from the earth to the sun. *20 digits for a radius equal to the ddistance from the earth to [[Polaris (star)|Polatis]].   People generally celebrate March 14 as [[Pi Day]], because March 14 is also written as 3/14, which represents the first three numbers 3.14 in the [[approximation]] of pi.<ref name="About Pi"/> Pi day started during 2001.  ==See also== {{quote box |align=left |quote= <div class="hlist"> * [[List of numbers]] * [[Irrational number|Irrational numbers]] </div> <div class="hlist"> * [[Apry's constant|{{mvar|}}(3)]] * [[Square root of 2|{{radic|2}}]] * [[Square root of 3|{{radic|3}}]] * [[Square root of 5|{{radic|5}}]] * [[Golden ratio|{{mvar|}}]] * [[E (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|e}}]] * [[Pi|{{pi}}]] * [[Squaring the circle]] * [[Transcendental number]] </div><noinclude> }} {{-}}  == References == {{reflist}}  [[Category:Geometry]] [[Category:Irrational numbers]] [[Category:Transcendental numbers]]</text>
