[[Science Museum]], London]]  '''James Watt''' (19 January 1736 {{ndash}} 19 August 1819) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[mathematician]] and [[engineer]]. He did not invent the first [[steam engine]], but he did modify it to work better. There were other patented steam engines (such as the Savery and Newcomen steam engines) in use by the time Watt started his work on them. His major contribution is in developing the modern form of the steam engine. The Watt steam engine is credited for driving the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 18th and 19th centuries. James Watt was a brilliant engineer and he also transformed the Newcomen engine.  Today, most people honor him by naming a [[unit]] of [[power (physics)|power]], the [[watt]], after him.  == Biography == James Watt was born on 19 January 1736 in [[Greenock]], [[Renfrewshire]]. His father was a [[shipwright]], ship owner and contractor, and served as the town's [[Baillie|chief baillie]]. His mother, Agnes Muirhead, came from a distinguished family and was well educated. Both were [[Presbyterian]]s and strong [[Covenanter]]s. Watt's grandfather, Thomas Watt, taught [[mathematics]] and was a baillie to the [[Baron of Cartsburn]]. Watt did not go to school every day. At first, he was mostly [[home school|schooled at home]] by his mother but later he attended Greenock grammar school.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tann|first=Jennifer|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|date=2004|chapter=James Watt (17361819)}}</ref> He exhibited great skill with his hands and a natural ability for [[mathematics]], although [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] failed to interest him. He also absorbed the [[Scottish mythology|legends and lore]] of the [[Scottish people]].  == The centrifugal governor == [[File:Boulton and Watt centrifugal governor-MJ.jpg|thumb|right|Centrifugal governor in a [[Boulton & Watt]] engine from 1788]] [[File:centrifugal governor.png|right|thumb|Drawing of a centrifugal "flyball" governor]]  One of Watt's many improvements was the invention of a "[[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] governor" to regulate automatically the speed of the engine. This is most obvious on [[steam engine]]s where it regulates the admission of [[steam]] into the [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]](s). It is also found on [[internal combustion engine]]s and variously fueled [[turbine]]s, and in some modern [[striking clock]]s.  A centrifugal governor is a [[homeostatic]] device which controls the [[speed]] of an [[engine]] by regulating the amount of "intermediate substance" (steam) which drives the machine. This keeps a near constant speed whatever the [[load]] or fuel supply conditions. It uses the principle of [[proportional control]]: this means the stopping of (in this case) steam varies according to the speed of the machine.  On Watt's fly-ball device, as the machine speeds up, the balls fly round faster. As they fly round faster, they move out from the central post. As they move out from the central post, they close the steam supply more firmly. As they do so, the machine slows down and the balls spin more slowly, and allow more steam into the cylinders. In addition, the system has a safety release valve to allow excess steam to escape without driving the wheels. 500 Boulton & Watt engines were built by the firm between 1775 and 1800.<ref>Hills, Richard Leslie 1993.

The firm of [[Boulton & Watt]] designed and built [[steam engine]]s, and was very important in the [[industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]].  === The Soho Foundry === At first the partnership made the drawing and specifications for the engines, and supervised the work to erect it on the customer's property. They produced almost none of the parts themselves. Watt did most of his work at his home in Harpers Hill in Birmingham, while Boulton worked at the Soho Manufactory.  Gradually the partners began to actually make more and more of the parts, and by 1795 they purchased a property about a mile away from the Soho manufactory, on the banks of the [[Birmingham Canal]]. There they built a new foundry for making the engines. The Soho Foundry opened in 1796 at a time when Watts sons, Gregory and James Jr. were heavily involved in the management of the enterprise. In 1800, the year of Watts retirement, the firm made a total of forty-one engines.<ref>Roll, Erich 1930. ''An early experiment in industrial organisation : being a history of the firm of Boulton & Watt. 17751805. London: Longmans, Green, p280</ref>  Watt retired in 1800, the same year that his fundamental [[patent]] and partnership with Boulton expired. The famous partnership was transferred to the men's sons, Matthew Robinson Boulton and James Watt Jr. Longtime firm engineer William Murdoch was soon made a partner and the firm prospered.  == Other websites == *[http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blsteamengine.htm History of Steam Engines]  == References == {{reflist}}  {{Authority control}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Watt, James}} [[Category:1736 births]] [[Category:1819 deaths]] [[Category:British engineers]] [[Category:British inventors]] [[Category:British mathematicians]] [[Category:Members of the Lunar Society]] [[Category:Scottish scientists]]</text>
