It is the biggest island on the [[continent]], located off the northern shore of [[France]] (across the [[English Channel]]) and to the west of [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] (across the [[North Sea]]).  Great Britain is not the name of a country. The island is part of the [[sovereign state]] called the [[United Kingdom]], and contains nearly all of three of its [[Countries of the United Kingdom|four countries]]: [[England]], [[Scotland]], and [[Wales]]. England is the biggest part of the island and its [[capital city]] is [[London]] (which is also the capital of the United Kingdom). Scotland is to the [[north]] of England, and its capital is [[Edinburgh]]. Wales is to the [[west]] of England, and its capital is [[Cardiff]]. Wales is separated from [[South West England]] by the [[Bristol Channel]].  West of Great Britain is a smaller island called [[Ireland]]. The island of Ireland contains nearly all of the [[Republic of Ireland]], which is a sovereign state, as well as nearly all of [[Northern Ireland]]. No part of Northern Ireland is on the island of Great Britain, but it is all part of the United Kingdom. Many people call the United Kingdom ''England'' or ''Great Britain'', and people from other parts of the United Kingdom may not like it when people make this mistake.  Together with many other smaller islands, Ireland and Great Britain form the [[British Isles]]. Because most of the island of Ireland is not [[British]], many people find this name inaccurate and even offensive. There is no more accurate term in common use but ''Great Britain and Ireland'' is often preferred.  ==Political definition== {{main|Kingdom of Great Britain|United Kingdom}}  Great Britain is the largest island of the [[United Kingdom]].

However, the island does not officially have a flag of its own.   ===History=== The political union that joined the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] happened in 1707 when the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] ratified the 1706 [[Treaty of Union]] and merged the parliaments of the two nations, forming the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], which covered the entire island.   Before this, a personal union had existed between these two countries since the 1603 [[Union of the Crowns]] under [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland and I of England]]. That union was called the ''[[Kingdom of Great Britain]]''.   In 1801, Ireland joined up with Great Britain, which made one country called the ''[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]''. The [[Irish Free State]] left the United Kingdom in 1922.  The national currency of Great Britain is the pound [[Pound sterling|sterling]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xe.com/currency/gbp-british-pound  |title=GBP Currency Information |author= |date=2016 |work=xe.com |publisher= |accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref>  ==More reading== * {{cite book|first=Andrew|last=Marr|title=The Making of Modern Britain: From Queen Victoria to V.E.
