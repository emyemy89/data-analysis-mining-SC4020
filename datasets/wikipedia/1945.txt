This is not always the same person as the [[head of state]]. Official titles for heads of government include [[Premier]] or [[Prime Minister]].  For example, in the [[United States]], the [[president]] is both the head of state and the head of government. In the [[Republic of Ireland]] the [[president]] is the head of state but the [[Taoiseach]] is the head of government. In most modern [[monarchy|monarchies]] the [[king]] (or [[queen]]) is the head of state but not the head of government, as is the case of [[Japan]] and the [[UK]], for example.  The head of state of some countries has no power over law and justice, for example, the [[Bundespresident]] of [[Germany]].  [[Category:Heads of government| ]]</text>
