Its [[capital (city)|capital city]] is [[Athens]].  It borders [[Albania]], [[North Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]] to the north, and [[Turkey]] to the east. The [[Aegean Sea]] is to the East and South of mainland Greece, the [[Ionian Sea]] is to the West. Both are part of the Eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] and have many islands. 80% of the country is mountainous, with [[Olympus|Mount Olympus]] being the highest peak.  [[Ancient Greece]] created [[democracy]], [[philosophy]], [[science]] and [[mathematics]], [[drama]] and [[Theatre|theater]] and the [[Olympic Games]].  Greece is a [[parliamentary republic]], in which the leader of the party with more seats in the [[parliament]] is the [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]]. The country has a President, but his powers are ceremonial. He is the [[head of state]], not head of government, much like how Kings and Queens operate in [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] and is elected by [[Parliament]] and not the people. Its economy is the highest in the [[Balkans]] region, though facing financial difficulties due to a [[Greek government-debt crisis]].  The [[official language]] spoken in Greece is [[Greek language|Greek]], spoken by 99% of the population and 90% of the population identifies as [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Christian Orthodox]]. Many Greeks also understand [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], which are taught in schools. Greece was a founding member of the [[United Nations]], joined NATO in 1952, became a member of the [[European Union]] in [[1981]] and adopted the [[Euro]] in 2001. Due to the large tourism industry, powerful shipping sector and its geostrategic importance, it is classified as a [[middle power]].  == History == {{Further|Ancient Greece}} [[File:Parthenon.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens]].]] [[Ancient Greece|Greece's history]] is one of the richest in the world. The Greeks were one of the most advanced civilizations. Greece is famous for its many [[philosophers]], like [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and kings like [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Leonidas]]. Greece is said to be the ''birthplace of [[Democracy]]'', because city-states like [[Athens]], now the capital of Greece, were the first to elect their leaders and not have [[king]]s. During the years of [[Alexander the Great]], a huge Macedonian empire was created that stretched from modern-day Greece to [[Egypt]] and [[Iran]], until the borders of [[India]].  Because of the significant role that Greek culture played during that time, it is called the [[Hellenistic period]] (or ''Greek-dominated period'').  During that time, the [[Greek language]] became the '[[lingua franca]]' of the [[Middle East]], which means the language that people who do not speak the same language use to communicate, like [[English language|English]] is used today as an international language.  Greece was then ruled by the [[Roman Empire]], and many argue that Rome conquered Greece with its army, but Greece conquered Rome with its culture. The Roman Empire after the conquest of Greece became a civilization known as the Greco-Roman (or Greek-Roman) civilization.  When the Roman Empire collapsed, the Greeks emerged as the ruling class of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and the [[Greek language]] became the official language of the empire, which included all the territories around the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]].  It was then occupied by the [[Ottoman Empire]] for a period of 400 years. Some areas of Greece, like the second-largest city in the country, [[Thessaloniki]], were occupied for 500 years and became part of Greece in the early 20th century.  [[File:Territorial Expansion of Greece from 18321947.gif|thumb|left|Greece was bigger in 1920 than it is today.]] The [[Greek War of Independence]] began in 1821 and Greece was an independent country (a republic) in 1828.  In 1832 Greece was made a kingdom by the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Russia]], under the [[Germany|German]] Wittelsbach dynasty.  In 1912, Greece took part in the [[Balkan Wars]], where it gained many of the territories that make up the country now, such as [[Greek Macedonia]] and the islands of the [[Aegean Sea]]. Greece fought in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] in the side of allies. During [[World War I]], Greece was divided into two countries, the [[State of Thessaloniki]] in the north and the [[State of Athens]] in the south.  Both countries claimed to be the legitimate government of Greece, but the State of Thessaloniki received support from the Allies.  The country was reunited in 1917, when the King abdicated.  In 1920 Greece expanded again, and briefly reached its maximum size.  The territories that the country had gained in [[Turkey]] were given back to Turkey in the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]], but Greece kept Western [[Thrace]].  The king returned in 1935, and Greece was under a [[fascism|fascist]] [[dictatorship]] from 1936 until 1941, friendly to the Allies, when it was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]].  In 1940, Greece was invaded by [[Italy]], but defeated the invasion. This was the first victory of an [[Allies of World War II|Allied country]] against an [[Axis countries|Axis power]]. After this, [[Hitler]] decided to attack Greece sooner than he had planned. Germany invaded on [[6 April]] [[1940]] and captured Greece's second-largest city of [[Thessaloniki]] on 9 April, while Athens was captured on 27 April. Most fighting ended with the [[Battle of Crete]]. Greece suffered major damages in the war.  Between 1946 and 1949, the Greeks fought a [[civil war]]. The fighting was between the [[communists]] and the people who supported the [[king]], who also had support from the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. The war left the country devastated and the people very poor.  In 1967 the military took control of the country and restricted democracy. Free elections were then held again 7 years later, and the Greeks voted to send the [[king]] away and declared a [[republic]] in 1974. Greece became a member of the [[European Union]] in 1981. Greece had seen rapid growth in the 1990s, but some of the country's economic statistics were modified to appear more correct than they were, as the government had lied with the help of banks from the [[United States]]. In 2004, Greece hosted the [[Olympic Games]] for a second time. Since 2009, Greece has been in an economic crisis, which is also becoming a political crisis. [[File:Greece topo.jpg|thumb|right|280px|The [[topography]] of Greece]]  == Politics == [[File:Hellenic Parliament-MPs swearing in.png|thumb|left|The Greek [[parliament]] is in [[Athens]].]] Greece is not a federal state like the [[United States]], but a [[unitary state]] like the [[United Kingdom]].  It  is ruled by a [[parliament]], called the ''Hellenic Parliament'' (or ''Greek Parliament'' in Simple English), which has 300 members. It is a [[parliamentary republic]], which means that, unlike in the [[United States]], the [[President]] has very few powers. The person in charge of the government of Greece is the [[Prime Minister]].  Greece was a kingdom for most of its history as an independent nation. It officially became the ''Third Hellenic Republic'' (or ''Third Republic of Greece'' in Simple English) in 1975, when the monarchy was abolished by a popular vote.  Greece was under a [[military dictatorship]] between 1966 and 1975.  Demonstrations by the students of the universities across Greece took place in 1973, but were suppressed by the regime, which forcibly stopped the protests.  The dictatorship collapsed after the [[invasion of Cyprus]], and handed over power to [[Constantine Karamanlis]].  There are many political parties in Greece, but only seven are in the Greek parliament.  Until 2015, only two political parties formed governments, the PASOK party (which is [[social democrat]]ic) and New Democracy (ND, which is [[conservatism|conservative]]).  The government ousted in the 2015 election was led by PASOK, DIMAR AND ND. Other parties include the [[Communist]] party, the left-wing [[SYRIZA]] party, the [[nationalist]] party and others. [[SYRIZA]], led by [[Alexis Tsipras]], won the [[2015]] [[parliament]]ary election held on [[January 25]] of that year, and entered into a coalition government with the small right-wing party ''Greek Independents''.  ===Divisions=== [[image:GreeceNumberedPerepheries.png|thumb|The peripheries to Greece.]] The divisions of Greece are called 'Peripheries'. As of January [[2011]], there are 13 peripheries in Greece.<ref name="Kallikratis">{{Cite web |url=http://www.delino.gr/N38522010_KALLIKRATIS_FEKA87_07062010.pdf |title=NOMO . 3852           .

A different flag (white cross on a blue field) was used as a land flag within Greece from 1828 until 1969 and from 1975 to 1978. In 1978 the current flag became [[national flag]] and the older land flag was abolished.  There are many theories about the origin of the color of the flag. One says that the blue represents the color of the sea and the white represents the waves, and others include white for the waves and blue for the sky and white for purity and breakaway from tyranny and blue for Greece. There are nine stripes on the flag, which according to the legend represent the nine syllables in the phrase    which means freedom or death. The cross stands for Christianity.  == Economy == [[File:Euro banknotes.png|thumb|left|The [[money]] used in Greece is called the [[euro]].]] Greece is a [[capitalist|capitalist country]], like the [[United States]] and [[France]]. Greece has the largest number of trading ships (a 'merchant navy') in the world. Tourism is also a major source of income for Greece. In the 20th century Greece had its own currency but now uses the [[Euro]] as most other European Community countries do.  Greece has adopted some [[welfare state]] policies, such as public healthcare and free education, like many other [[Europe]]an countries. Greece, however, has not collected enough taxes to pay for them. The [[pension]] system is especially expensive.  This is putting Greece in a very difficult situation when the country has accumulated a debt of about 350 billion, or debt by 170 per-cent of the country's total GDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gp.se/1.866580|title=Samtal om grekisk koalitionsregering|first=|last=TT-Reuters|website=gp.se}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://prevarication.net/2010/05/greek-collapse-spurs-selloff-greek-retirement-age-as-early-as-50/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-16 |archive-date=2011-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130132629/http://prevarication.net/2010/05/greek-collapse-spurs-selloff-greek-retirement-age-as-early-as-50/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Greece also has a trade deficit, meaning that it buys more things than it sells.  The country is cutting costs and asking for loans in order to avoid bankruptcy.  == Tourism == About 30 million tourists visit Greece each year. That is more than the countrys entire population. To serve the many tourists, Greece has many international [[airport]]s. Tourism also makes up more than 20% of the Greek GDP.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Chloe Wynne |title=Greek tourism sector growing over three times faster than wider economy says new WTTC research |url=https://www.wttc.org/about/media-centre/press-releases/press-releases/2019/greek-tourism-sector-growing-over-three-times-faster-than-wider-economy-says-new-wttc-research/ |website=WTTC |accessdate=21 April 2019}}</ref>  == Related pages == * [[Greece at the Olympics]] * [[Greece national football team]] * [[List of Greek islands]] * [[List of rivers of Greece]]  == References == {{reflist}}  {{commons}} {{European Union}} {{North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)}} {{authority control}}  [[Category:Greece| ]] [[Category:European Union member states]]</text>
