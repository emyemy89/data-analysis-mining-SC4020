<title>Natural gas</title><text>[[File:Darvasa gas crater panorama.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Door to Hell, a natural gas field in [[Turkmenistan]].  It has been burning continuously since 1971, fed by the rich natural gas deposits in the area.]]  '''Natural gas''' is a [[mixture]] of [[gas]]<nowiki/>es. It consists mainly of [[hydrocarbon]]s. The main component is [[methane]]. Natural gas is often found in the ground, either alone or together with [[petroleum]]. [[Landfill]]s and natural processes produce a little methane. Usually it is transported to users in a [[pipeline]].  Most natural gas is burnt as a [[fuel]] to produce [[energy]]. It burns with a clean [[blue]] flame, causing little [[pollution]].  Natural gas is burned to produce [[electricity]], to cook and to heat buildings. It is also used as fuel for [[natural gas vehicle]]s for transport. When natural gas is burned in a [[power station]] it boils water into steam that spins a steam [[turbine]] that turns a [[generator]] to make [[electricity]]. Some power stations use natural gas in a gas turbine.   Natural gas is also converted into many different industrial chemicals. It is the most common feedstock for making pure [[hydrogen]]. Hydrogen is used as fuel in [[fuel cell]]s, and to make [[ammonia]]. Ammonia is used as a fuel, as a [[fertilizer]] for crops, and for making many other things. Natural gas is also converted into [[monomer]]s to make many plastic products.   ==Related pages== {{commons category|Natural gas}} *[[Fossil fuel]] *[[Coal]] *[[non-renewable resource]]  == Other websites == *[http://www.fossil.energy.gov/education/energylessons/gas/index.html History of using natural gas from the U.S. Department of Energy]  {{science-stub}}  [[Category:Fossil fuels]] [[Category:Hydrocarbons]]</text>
