Its neighbors are [[Finland]] and [[Norway]]. Sweden is also connected to [[Denmark]] in the south by a bridge. It is a [[developed country]]. It is famous for its [[welfare state]]. People who live in Sweden are called Swedes.  The population of Sweden is about 10 million people.<ref name="&quot;stats sweden&quot;">{{cite web|url=https://sweden.se/quick-facts/population/|title=Sweden website|first=|last=|date=31 May 2013|website=|publisher=Statistics Sweden website|accessdate=27 July 2013}}</ref> Sweden's [[capital (city)|capital]] [[city]] is [[Stockholm]], which is also Sweden's largest city, with almost one million people. Other large cities are [[Gothenburg]] and [[Malm]]. These cities are all in the southern half of the country, where it is not as cold as in the north. Swedes drink filmjlk, it is a traditional fermented milk product from Sweden. It is made by fermenting cow's milk. Glogg, is spiced mulled wine. It normally contains red wine, sugar, orange peel, and spices. Swedes eat yellow pea soup with pork (or pork sausages) along with mustard.  Sweden is a [[constitutional monarchy]] because it has a king, [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]], but he does not have any real power. Sweden is a parliamentary state meaning that the [[government]] is [[election|elected]] by the [[parliament]] which is appointed by the people. The country is [[democracy|democratically]] ruled by a government headed by an elected [[prime minister]]. [[Stefan Lfven]] was elected [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] in September 2014. He took office in October 2014.  Sweden has an official majority language, [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (the Swedish word for the language is ''svenska''). Sweden has five official [[minority language]]s: [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Yiddish]], [[Sami language|Sami]], [[Menkieli]], and [[Romani]].  Sweden became a member of the [[European Union]] (EU) on 1 January [[1995]]. Unlike most countries in the European Union, Sweden is not a member of the [[Eurozone]] and has not begun to use the [[euro]] as currency. This is because the people have voted against using the euro. The [[currency]] remains the [[Swedish krona]] (Swedish crown).  == History == Sweden has been a country for a thousand years. In the Middle Ages Sweden had the same king as Denmark and Norway. In the early 16th century Sweden got its own king, Gustav Vasa. During the 17th century Sweden was a great power. Sweden had taken Estonia, Latvia, and Finland and parts of Norway, Germany, and Russia. In the 18th century Sweden became weaker and lost these places. In the early 19th century Sweden's king died without an heir and the Swedish parliament voted for Jean Baptiste Bernadotte as the new king. Bernadotte fought Denmark and made them allow Norway to enter a [[Union of Sweden and Norway|personal union with Sweden]].  This was Sweden's last war, and Sweden has not been at war for 200 years. In 1905, the Swedish-Norwegian personal union was dissolved. In many wars, including [[World War I]] and the [[Cold War]], the country was neutral, meaning it did not take sides.  During [[World War II]], it traded with both the [[British]] and the [[Germans]] in order to protect its neutrality.  == Region == Sweden is divided into 21 counties. They are [[Stockholm County|Stockholm]], [[Uppsala County|Uppsala]], [[Sdermanland County|Sdermanland]], [[stergtland County|stergtland]], [[Jnkping County|Jnkping]], [[Kronoberg County|Kronoberg]], [[Kalmar County|Kalmar]], [[Gotland County|Gotland]], [[Blekinge County|Blekinge]], [[Skne County|Skne]], [[Halland County|Halland]], [[Vstra Gtaland County|Vstra Gtaland]], [[Vrmland County|Vrmland]], [[rebro County|rebro]], [[Vstmanland County|Vstmanland]], [[Dalarna County|Dalarna]], [[Gvleborg County|Gvleborg]], [[Vsternorrland County|Vsternorrland]], [[Jmtland County|Jmtland]], [[Vsterbotten County|Vsterbotten]], and [[Norrbotten County|Norrbotten]].  Sweden has 25 historical provinces (''landskap''). They are found in three different regions: [[Norrland]] in the North, [[Svealand]] in the central region, and [[Gtaland]] in the South.  == Religion == Sweden has been Christian for a thousand years. Sweden is traditionally a Protestant country, but it is now one of the least religious countries in the world. [[Statistical survey]]s say 46-85% of all people in Sweden are [[agnostic]]s or [[atheism|atheists]]. This means they do not believe in a [[god]].<ref>Zuckerman, Phil (2007), Atheism: Contemporary Rates and Patterns PDF i Cambridge Companion to Atheism.
