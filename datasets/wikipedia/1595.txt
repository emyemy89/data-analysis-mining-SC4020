<title>Point (geometry)</title><text>A '''point''' is a precise [[position]] in [[Space (physics)|space]]. Imagine touching a piece of paper with a sharp pencil or pen, without making any sideways movement. We know where the point is, but it has no size to speak of.  In [[geometry]], a point has no [[size]], but has a position. This means it has no [[volume]], [[area]] or [[length]]. We usually [[represent]] a point by a small [[cross]] 'X' or by a small '''dot''' (a small, round shape). Points are always labelled by [[capital letter]]s (A, B, C...X, Y, Z).<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2020-04-17|title=List of Geometry and Trigonometry Symbols|url=https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/geometry-trigonometry-symbols/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-24|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Point - math word definition - Math Open Reference|url=https://www.mathopenref.com/point.html|access-date=2020-09-24|website=www.mathopenref.com}}</ref> It is one of the most fundamental but undefined terms in geometry.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Points, Lines, and Planes|url=https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/geometry/fundamental-ideas/points-lines-and-planes|access-date=2020-09-24|website=www.cliffsnotes.com}}</ref>  In general, '''two points''' can be: * Coincident (they are one and the same) * Not coincident (they are not one and the same) and are always: * Coplanar (on the same plane) * Colinear (on the same line) * Concyclic (on the same circle)  '''Three points''' can be: * Colinear * Coincident * Not coincident * Not colinear and are always: * Coplanar * Concyclic  '''Four points''' can be:  * Coplanar * Colinear * Coincident * Not coincident * Not colinear * Not coplanar  == Related pages ==  * [[Line]] * [[Plane (mathematics)|Plane]]  == References == <references />   {{math-stub}}  [[Category:Geometry]]</text>
