<title>Supernatural</title><text>The word '''supernatural''' (from {{lang-la|superntrlis}}) is used for things that some people believe are [[Reality|real]], but that are not part of [[nature]] or inexplicable by the [[Science|scientific]] [[Scientific law|laws of nature]]. Because we cannot [[wikt:prove|prove]] whether these things are real, people often disagree about these things.  Some say that we should talk about things without talking about the supernatural, because we cannot prove that supernatural things are real. Other people say that although we cannot prove supernatural things in a scientific way, they are real. Some examples of supernatural things or examples are:  * [[Witchcraft|magic]] * [[miracle]]s * [[precognition]] * [[demonic possession]]  * [[soul]]s, [[spirit]]s or [[ghost]]s * [[Monster|monsters]] * ''[[ykai]]'' * [[Death (personification)|grim reaper]] * [[angel]]s * [[devil]]s, [[asura]]s or [[demon]] * [[kami]] * [[UFOs]] * [[legendary creature]]s * [[God]] or [[Deity|gods]] * [[parapsychology]]  ==Related pages== *[[Religion]] *[[Belief]] *[[Superstition]] *[[Ritual]] *[[Near death experiences]]    [[Category:Religion]]    {{religion-stub}}</text>
