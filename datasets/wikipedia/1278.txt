It deals with [[Electrical circuit|circuits]] that are made with parts called [[Electronic component|components]] and connecting wires that control the flow of [[electricity]] and direct it to do useful things.  The science behind Electronics comes from the study of [[physics]] and gets applied in real-life ways through the field of [[electrical engineering]].  Most people can name and several simple electronic components, such as transistors, fuses, circuit breakers, batteries, motors, transformers, LEDs and bulbs, but as the number of components starts to increase, it often helps to think in terms of smaller systems or blocks, which can be connected together to do something useful.   One way of looking at an [[electronic system]] is to separate it into three parts: # Inputs - Electrical or mechanical [[sensor]]s, which take [[signal (electrical engineering)|signals]] from the physical world (in the form of temperature, pressure, etc.) and convert them into electric current and voltage signals. # Signal processing circuits - These consist of electronic components connected together to manipulate, interpret and transform the information contained in the signals. # Outputs - [[Actuator]]s or other devices that transform current and voltage signals back into human readable information.  A [[television]] set, for example, has as its input a [[broadcast]] signal received from an [[antenna]], or for [[cable television]], a cable.  Signal processing circuits inside the television set use the [[brightness]], [[colour]], and [[sound]] information contained in the received signal to control the television set's output devices. The display output device may be a [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) or a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] or [[liquid crystal display]] screen. The audio output device might be a [[magnetic]]ally driven audio [[loudspeaker|speaker]]. The display output devices convert the signal processing circuits' brightness and colour information into the visible [[image]] displayed on a screen. The audio output device converts the processed sound information into sounds that can be heard by listeners.  Analysis of a [[electrical circuit|circuit]]/[[network]] involves knowing the input and the signal processing circuit, and finding out the output. Knowing the input and output and finding out or [[Circuit design|designing]] the signal processing part is called ''[[synthesis]]''.  == History == People started experimenting with electricity as early as 600 B.C.E, when [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]] discovered rubbing [[fur]] on [[amber]] would cause them to attract each other.<!-- to-do: all the rest of history -->  Starting in the 1900s, devices used glass or metal [[vacuum]] [[vacuum tube|tubes]] to control the flow of electricity. With these components a low power voltage can be used to change another. This revolutionized [[radio]], and allowed other inventions.  In the 1960s and early 1970s [[transistor]]<nowiki/>s and [[semiconductor]] began replacing vacuum tubes. Transistors can be made much smaller than vacuum tubes and they can work using less energy.  At about the same time, [[integrated circuit]]s (circuits that are integrated inside other circuits) became commonly used. Integrated circuits made it possible to reduce the number of parts needed to make electronic products and made the products much cheaper in general.  == Analog circuits == [[Analog signal|Analog]] circuits are used for signals that have a range of [[amplitude]]s. In general, analog circuits measure or control the amplitude of signals. In the early days of electronics, all electronic devices used analog circuits. The [[frequency]] of the analog circuit is often measured or controlled in analog signal processing. Even though more digital circuits are made, analog circuits will always be necessary, since the world and its people work in analog ways.  == Pulse circuits == Pulse circuits are used for signals that require rapid pulses of energy. For example, [[aircraft]] and ground [[radar]] equipment work by using pulse circuits to create and send high powered bursts of radio energy from radar [[transmitter]]s. Special antennas (called "beam" or "dish" antennas because of their shape) are used to send ("transmit") the high powered bursts in the direction the beam or dish antenna is pointed.  The radar transmitter's pulses or bursts of radio energy hit and bounce back (they are "reflected") from hard and metallic objects. Hard objects are things like buildings, hills, and mountains. Metallic objects are anything made of metal, like aircraft, bridges, or even objects in space, like [[Satellite (artificial)|satellites]]. The reflected radar energy is detected by radar pulse [[receiver]]s which use both pulse and digital circuits together. The pulse and digital circuits in radar pulse receivers are used to show the location and distance of objects which have reflected the radar transmitter's high powered pulses.  By controlling how often the rapid pulses of radar energy are sent out by a radar transmitter (called the transmitter's "pulse timing"), and how long it takes for the reflected pulse energy to come back to the radar receiver, one can tell not only where objects are, but also how far away they are. Digital circuits in a radar receiver calculate the distance to an object by knowing the time interval between energy pulses. The radar receiver's digital circuits count how long it takes between pulses for an object's reflected energy to be detected by the radar receiver. Since radar pulses are sent and received at approximately the [[speed of light]], the distance to an object can easily be calculated. This is done in digital circuits by multiplying the speed of light by the time it takes to receive the radar energy reflected back from an object.  The time between pulses (often called "pulse rate time", or PRT) sets the limit on how far away an object can be detected. That distance is called the "range" of a radar transmitter and receiver. Radar transmitters and receivers use long PRT's to find the distance to objects that are far away. Long PRT's makes it possible to accurately determine the distance to the moon, for example. Fast PRT's are used to detect objects that are much closer, like ships at sea, high flying aircraft, or to determine the speed of fast moving automobiles on highways.  == Digital circuits == [[File:Half adder.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a half adder, a digital circuit]] Digital circuits are used for signals that only turn on and off instead of often working at levels somewhere between on and off. Active components in digital circuits typically have one signal level when turned on, and another signal level when turned off. In general, in digital circuits a component is only switched on and off.  [[Computer]]s and electronic [[clock]]s are examples of electronic devices that are made up of mostly [[digital circuit]]s.
