In 1859, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] showed that the rings cannot be solid, but are made of small particles, each orbiting Saturn on their own, otherwise, it would become unstable or break apart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Maxwell_Saturn.html |title=James Clerk Maxwell on the nature of Saturn's rings |first=James Clerk |last=Maxwell |work=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk |year=1859 |access-date=2011-06-19}}</ref> [[James Keeler]] studied the rings using a [[spectrometer|spectroscope]] in 1895 which proved Maxwell's theory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.si.edu/DigitalCollections/HST/Huygens/huygens-introduction.htm |title=Christiaan Huygens and his Systema Saturnium |author=Brashear, Ronald |date=May 1999 |publisher= [[Smithsonian Institution]] Libraries|access-date=2011-04-19}}</ref>  === Physical features === The rings range from {{convert|6630|km|mi|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} to {{convert|120700|km|mi|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} above the planet's equator. As proved by Maxwell, even though the rings appear to be solid and unbroken when viewed from above, the rings are made of small particles of rock and ice. They are only about {{convert|10|m|ft|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} thick; made of [[silicon dioxide|silica]] rock, [[iron oxide]] and ice particles.<ref name=cosmos />{{rp|55}} The smallest particles are only specks of dust while the largest are the size of a house.

Scientists believe this is caused by the [[gravity|gravitational force]] of some of Saturn's moons. The tiny moon [[Pan (moon)|Pan]] orbits inside Saturn's rings, creating a gap within the rings. Other ringlets keep their structure due to the gravitational force of [[shepherd satellite]]s, such as [[Prometheus (moon)|Prometheus]] and [[Pandora (moon)|Pandora]]. Other gaps form due to the gravitational force of a large moon farther away. The moon [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] is responsible for clearing away the Cassini gap.<ref name="Cassini_Division" />  Recent data from the Cassini spacecraft has shown that the rings have their own atmosphere, free from the planet's atmosphere. The rings' atmosphere is made of oxygen gas, and it is produced when the Sun's [[ultraviolet]] light breaks up the water ice in the rings. [[Chemical reaction]] also occurs between the ultraviolet light and the water [[molecule]]s, creating hydrogen gas. The oxygen and hydrogen atmospheres around the rings are very widely spaced.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4640641.stm |title=Saturn rings have own atmosphere |first=Paul |last=Rincon |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2005-07-01 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |access-date=2011-06-19}}</ref> As well as oxygen and hydrogen gas, the rings have a thin atmosphere made of [[hydroxide]].

These photos were able to show the surface features of the moons. Voyager 1 went close to Titan, and gained much information about its atmosphere. In August, 1981, [[Voyager 2]] continued to study the planet. Photos taken by the space probe showed that changes were happening to the rings and atmosphere. The Voyager spacecrafts discovered a number of moons orbiting close to Saturn's rings, as well as discovering new ring gaps.  [[File:Cassini Saturn Orbit Insertion.jpg|thumbnail|right|Drawing of Cassini in orbit around Saturn]]  On July 1, 2004, the CassiniHuygens probe entered into orbit around Saturn. Before then, it flew close to [[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]], taking very high resolution photos of its surface and collecting data. On December 25, 2004, the Huygens probe separated from the Cassini probe before moving down towards Titan's surface and landed there on January 14, 2005. It landed on a dry surface, but it found that large bodies of liquid exist on the moon. The Cassini probe continued to collect data from Titan and a number of the icy moons. It found evidence that the moon Enceladus had water erupting from its [[geyser]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/09mar_enceladus/ |title=Radical!
