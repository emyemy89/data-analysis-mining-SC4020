<title>Second</title><text>{{otheruses}} [[File:Flashingsecond.gif|thumb|A light flashing once per second.]] The '''second''' (symbol: '''s'''), is a [[units of measurement|unit]] of [[time]]. There is around 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day. This tradition dates back to the [[Babylonian]].  In science, a second is the time it takes for a [[caesium]] [[atom]] to vibrate 9,192,631,770 (around 9 billion) times. Scientists measure the second this way because the length of a day changes all the time. For example, when the [[dinosaur]]s were around, a day was only 21 hours. Vibrations of [[atom]]s on the other hand always take the same time. This '''atomic second''' is also called the [[SI]] second.  [[International System of Units#Prefixes|Metric prefixes]] are frequently combined with the word ''second'' to denote subdivisions of the second, ''e.g.'', the [[millisecond]] (one thousandth of a second) and [[nanosecond]] (one billionth of a second). Though SI prefixes may also be used to form multiples of the second (such as kilosecond, or one thousand seconds), such units are rarely used in practice. More commonly encountered, non-SI units of time such as the [[minute]], [[hour]], and [[day]] increase by multiples of 60 and 24 (rather than by powers of ten as in the SI system).  == International second == Under the [[International System of Units]], the second is currently defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 [[Period (physics)|periods]] of the radiation [[wikt:correspond|correspond]]ing to the [[wikt:transition|transition]] between the two [[Hyperfine structure|hyperfine levels]] of the [[ground state]] of the [[caesium]]-133 [[atom]].<ref name="USNO">{{cite web | title = Leap Seconds | publisher = Time Service Department, [[United States Naval Observatory]] | url = http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html | access-date = 2006-12-31 }}</ref> This definition refers to a caesium atom at rest at a temperature of {{convert|0|K|C F|abbr=off}} ([[absolute zero]]). The ground state is defined at zero magnetic field.<ref name="USNO"/> The second thus defined is equivalent to the [[ephemeris]] second.  The international standard symbol for a second is '''s''' (see [[ISO 31-1]])  == Equivalence to other units of time == 1 international second is equal to: * 1/60 [[minute]] (1 minute is equal to 60 seconds) * 1/3,600 [[hour]] (1 hour is equal to 3,600 seconds) * 1/86,400 [[day]] (1 day, in the sense of non-SI units accepted for use with the International System of Units, is equal to 86,400 seconds) There are 31,536,000 seconds in a [[common year]], 31,622,400 seconds in a [[leap year]], and 31,557,600 seconds in a [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]]  == Historical origin == Originally, the second was known as a "second minute", meaning the second minute (i.e. small) division of an hour. The first division was known as a "prime minute" and is equivalent to the [[minute]] we know today. Third and fourth minutes were sometimes used in calculations.  The factor of 60 comes from the [[Babylon]]ians who used a [[sexagesimal]] (base-60) [[numeral system]]. However, the Babylonians did not subdivide their time units sexagesimally (except for the day). The [[hour]] had been defined by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians as either 1/12 of daytime or 1/12 of nighttime, hence both varied with the seasons. Greek astronomers, for example [[Hipparchus]] and [[Ptolemy]], defined the hour as 1/24 of a mean [[solar time|solar day]]. Sexagesimally subdividing this mean solar hour made the second 1/86,400 of a mean solar day.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Definition of MEAN SOLAR DAY|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mean+solar+day|access-date=2020-08-12|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en}}</ref>   Greek time periods, for example the mean [[Orbital period|synodic month]], were usually specified quite precisely because they were ''calculated'' from carefully selected [[eclipse]]s separated by hundreds of yearsindividual ''mean'' synodic months and similar time periods cannot be measured. Nevertheless, with the development of [[pendulum]] clocks keeping ''mean time'' (as opposed to the ''apparent time'' displayed by sundials), the second became measurable. The seconds pendulum was proposed as a unit of length as early as 1660 by the [[Royal Society of London]]. The duration of a beat or half period (one swing, not back and forth) of a pendulum one [[metre]] in length on the Earth's surface is approximately one second.<ref>[http://www.roma1.infn.it/~dagos/history/sm/node3.html The seconds pendulum]</ref>  In 1956 the second was defined in terms of the period of revolution of the [[Earth]] around the Sun for a particular [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]], because by then it had become recognized that the Earth's rotation on its own axis was not sufficiently uniform as a standard of time. The Earth's motion was described in [[Newcomb's Tables of the Sun]], which provides a formula for the motion of the Sun at the epoch 1900 based on astronomical observations made between 1750 and 1892.<ref name="USNO"/> The second thus defined is  :''the fraction 1/31,556,925.9747 of the [[tropical year]] for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours ephemeris time.''<ref name="USNO"/>  This definition was ratified by the Eleventh General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960. The ''tropical year'' in the definition was not measured, but calculated from a formula describing a tropical year which decreased linearly over time, hence the curious reference to a specific ''instantaneous'' tropical year. Because this second was the independent variable of time used in [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] of the Sun and Moon during most of the twentieth century (Newcomb's Tables of the Sun were used from 1900 through 1983, and [[Ernest William Brown|Brown]]'s Tables of the Moon were used from 1920 through 1983), it was called the ephemeris second.<ref name="USNO"/>  When [[atomic clock]]<nowiki/>s were made, they became the basis of the definition of the second, rather than the revolution of the Earth around the Sun.  Following several years of work, Louis Essen from the [[National Physical Laboratory]] (Teddington, England) and William Markowitz from the [[United States Naval Observatory]] (USNO) determined the relationship between the hyperfine transition frequency of the [[caesium]] atom and the ephemeris second.<ref name="USNO"/> Using a common-view measurement method based on the received signals from [[radio station]] [[WWV (radio station)|WWV]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=The definition of the 'atomic' second|journal=Metrologia|first=Sigfrido|last=Leschiutta|volume=42|issue=3|pages=S10S19|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0026-1394/42/S10}}</ref> they determined the orbital motion of the [[Moon]] about the Earth, from which the apparent motion of the Sun could be inferred, in terms of time as measured by an atomic clock. As a result, in 1967 the Thirteenth [[Confrence Gnrale des Poids et Mesures|General Conference on Weights and Measures]] defined the second of [[International Atomic Time|atomic time]] in the [[SI|International System of Units (SI)]] as  :''the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom.''<ref name="USNO"/>  The [[ground state]] is defined at zero [[magnetic field]]. The second thus defined is equivalent to the ephemeris second.<ref name="USNO"/>  The definition of the second was later refined at the 1997 meeting of the [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures|BIPM]] to include the statement  :''This definition refers to a caesium atom at rest at a temperature of 0 K.''  The revised definition would seem to imply that the ideal atomic clock would contain a single caesium atom at rest emitting a single frequency. In practice, however, the definition means that high-precision realizations of the second should compensate for the effects of the ambient temperature ([[black-body radiation]]) within which atomic clocks operate and extrapolate accordingly to the value of the second as defined above.  == The second in role-playing games==  Sometimes in [[Role-playing game|role-playing games]] a second is used to refer to a small period of time or a single turn of combat. It is used as a standard moment of time, and does not necessarily refer to a real second, and could be shorter or longer depending on the scenario.  == Trivia == * Until modern times, degrees and hours were divided successively by 60 in ''pars minuta prima'', ''pars minuta secunda'', ''pars minuta tertia'' and so on. This evolved to the modern minute and second, but for smaller divisions we follow now the decimal division. In some languages, dictionaries still keep the word for ''third'' for 1/60 of a second, for example Polish (''tercja'') and Arabic ().  ==Related pages== * [[Leap second]] * [[Orders of magnitude (time)]] * [[UTC]] * [[SI#Units|International System of Units]] * [[Hertz]] * [[Becquerel]]  == References == {{reflist}}  == Other websites == * [http://www.bipm.fr/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/second.html Official BIPM definition of the second] * [http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html Seconds and leap seconds by the USNO] * [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/time/metrologia-leapsecond.pdf The leap second: its history and possible future]  {{SI units}}  [[Category:Units of time]] [[Category:Basic English 850 words]] [[Category:SI units]]</text>
