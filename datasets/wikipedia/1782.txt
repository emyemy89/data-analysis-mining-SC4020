He was the son of [[Kim Il-Sung|Kim Il-Sng]]. Official North Korean [[propaganda]] said that Jong-il was born on Mount Paektu (a holy mountain in Korea); but most [[historian]]s think that he was born near Chabarowsk in the [[Soviet Union]]. The North Korean laws made him permanent ruler of North Korea for life. He was sometimes referred to as the "Dear Leader", but this was not an official title. His official title was "Chairman of the National Defense Commission of North Korea", "Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army" and "General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea". Many people in North Korea were imprisoned or killed for speaking out against the Kim [[regime]]. Almost everyone in North Korea wore a small pin with a picture of Kim Jng-Il or Kim Il-Sng on it.  The North Korean [[government]] told people of his death through the [[state]] [[media]] on 19 December 2011. It was said that he had died two days earlier of "[[Human body|physical]] and [[mental]] over-work".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16239693|title=N Korean leader Kim Jong-il dies|date=19 December 2011|accessdate=19 December 2011|publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/12/19/north_korean_leader_kim_jong_il_69_has_died/|title=North Korean Leader Kim Jong Il, 69, Has Died|date=19 December 2011|accessdate=19 December 2011|publisher=Salon}}</ref>  {{Infobox Korean name |context = north |hangul  =  |hanja   = {{linktext||||}} |rr      = Gim Jeong(-)il |mr      = Kim Chngil }} ==Early life== Jong-il was born '''Yuri Irsenovich Kim''' on 16 February 1941.  ==Personal life== Jong-il was a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]]. He believed in the North Korean [[Communist]] philosophy of [[Juche]] (self-reliance). He was afraid to travel on [[aeroplane]]s and traveled only on [[Railway|train]]s. He was well known for his love of [[movie]]s and luxury goods, especially [[caviar]] and Hennessey brand [[cognac]], even though North Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world. Former [[United States]] [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Madeleine Albright]] once gave Jong-il a present of a [[basketball]] signed by [[Michael Jordan]] when he visited North Korea because Jong-il was a fan of the [[National Basketball Association]] and of Michael Jordan.  ==Death== On the morning of 17 December 2011, at the age of 69 or 70,  Jong-il died of a heart attack while traveling. His funeral was held on 28 December, and as a result, [[Kim Jong-un]] was then elected as the new leader of [[North Korea]]. On 13 April 2012, Kim Jong-il was made Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission and Eternal General Secretary of the Workers Party of Korea.  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==Other websites== {{sisterlinks|Kim Jong-il}}  * {{PDFlink|[http://www.korea-dpr.com/library/103.pdf Kim Jong Il: Brief History]|893&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 915125 bytes -->}}  Foreign Languages Publishing House, Pyongyang DPR Korea (1998) * [http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200406/kt2004060817432954140.htm Born in the USSR]  Kim Jong-il's childhood. * [http://www.east-asia-intel.com/eai/Sample/2.html The many family secrets of Kim Jong Il] * [http://theseoultimes.com/ST/?url=/ST/db/read.php?idx=1643 "Hidden Daughter" Visits Kim Jong-il Every Year] (also includes photos of Kim during his youth) * [http://news.naver.com/news/read.php?mode=LSD&office_id=047&article_id=0000073978&section_id=100&menu_id=100 Kim's family tree] {{in lang|ko}}   {{bio-stub}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Kim, Jong-il}} [[Category:1941 births]] [[Category:2011 deaths]] [[Category:Dictators]] [[Category:Former dictators]] [[Category:North Korean military people]] [[Category:North Korean politicians]] [[Category:Deaths from myocardial infarction]]</text>
