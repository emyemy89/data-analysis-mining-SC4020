[[Wood]], [[bone]]s, and other materials were also used for tools, but those things don't last as long, so more stone tools are found. Stone (especially a hard kind of stone called [[flint]]) was used to cut things.   The period began with the first [[stone tool]]s, about 2.7 [[million]] [[year]]s ago. Some groups of people were still in the stone age into the 20th century. They also killed animals for food and clothing. They used animal skin for their shelters.  The time after the Stone Age is the [[Bronze Age]], named after the [[metal]] [[bronze]]. The Stone Age ended when people discovered the art of [[metallurgy|smelting]] (making metals). The first metal used was [[copper]], followed by bronze. People probably began using bronze instead of just stone in the [[Middle East]] sometime between 3000 and 2000 BC.   The Stone Age is divided by [[Archaeology|archaeologist]]<nowiki/>s (people who study relics) into three sections: [[Paleolithic]] ("old stone"), [[Mesolithic]] ("middle stone"), and [[Neolithic]] ("new stone"). [[Pottery]] was invented during the Neolithic Stone Age.  The '''[[Palaeolithic]]''' <ref>from Greek: , ''palaios'', "[[old]]"; and , ''lithos'', "stone" lit. "old age of the stone"; was coined by archaeologist [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] in 1865.</ref> is a [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] era distinguished by the development of [[stone tool]]s. It covers the greatest portion of humanity's time (roughly 99% of human history) on [[Earth]], from about 2.7 million years ago to about 20,000 years ago. It was followed by the [[Mesolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] cultures.<ref name=Thoth&Schick>{{cite book |title=Handbook of Paleoanthropology |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/u68378621542472j/ |author=Nicholas Toth and Kathy Schick |year=2007 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |isbn=978-3-540-32474-4 |access-date=2010-05-14 |archive-date=2020-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200413223257/http://www.springerlink.com/content/u68378621542472j/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>  == References == {{Reflist}}  [[Category:Stone Age| ]]</text>
