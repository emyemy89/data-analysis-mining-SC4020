<title>Mysticism</title><text>'''Mysticism''' is the belief that people can ''directly'' experience [[God]] or true [[reality]], rather than through books, ritual or other people. People who practice this are called ''mystics''.  Mystics exist within most [[religion]]s, though not all people who practice religions are mystics. Mystics may experience [[vision]]s or [[dream]]s, or hear God as a voice.  ==Hindu mystics== Some examples of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] mystics:  :[[Adi Sankara|Shankara]] :[[Ramakrishna Paramhansa|Sri Ramakrishna]]  ==Christian mystics== Some examples of [[Christianity|Christian]] mystics:  :[[Augustine of Hippo]] (354430) :[[Pope Gregory I|Gregory I]] (590604) :[[Bridget of Sweden]] (13031373) :[[John of the Cross]] (15421591) :[[George Fox]] (16241691) :[[William Blake]] (17571827) :[[Thomas Merton]] (19151968)  ==Islamic mystics== Islamic Mysticism is known as ''Tassawuf'' (or Sufism) and a detailed list of [[Muslim]] Sufi mystics is given on the [[Sufism]] page.  ==Jewish mystics== Some examples of [[Jew]]ish mystics:  :[[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]] (1902-1994)  ==Buddhist mystics== Some examples of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] mystics:  :[[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]] (563 BC-483 BC) :[[Bodhidharma]] (440-528)  ==Related page== *[[Spirituality]]  {{religion-stub}} [[Category:Theology]] [[Category:Reality]]</text>
