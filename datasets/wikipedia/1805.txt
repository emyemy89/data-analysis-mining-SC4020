<title>Table salt</title><text>[[File:Selpologne.jpg|thumb|A magnified crystal of salt]]  '''Table salt''' is a [[mineral]] composed mainly of [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl). This is a [[chemical compound]], one of many [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]]. Salt in its natural form as a [[crystallinity|crystalline]] mineral is known as rock salt or [[halite]].   When salt (sodium chloride) is mixed with water, the salt dissolves into the water, creating a saline solution. Salt is present in vast quantities in [[seawater]], where it is the main mineral constituent. The open ocean has about {{convert|35|g|oz}} of solids per litre, a [[salinity]] of 3.5%.  Salt can be made by either [[evaporation]] or can be [[Mining|mined]]. To get sea salt, man-made holes are built then filled with [[sea water]]. The water evaporates and leaves salt behind.  {{-}} {{chem-stub}}  [[Category:Condiments|Salt]] [[Category:Sodium compounds]] [[Category:Chlorine compounds]]</text>
