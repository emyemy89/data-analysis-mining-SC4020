A big river called the [[Guadalquivir]] River goes through Seville.  The city of Seville is the capital of the Spanish region called [[Andalusia]] and of the province of [[Province of Seville|Sevilla]]. The people who live in the city are called ''Sevillanos'' and there are almost a million of them: 700,000.  == History == A very old story says that the city was started by the famous hero of [[Greece]], named [[Hercules]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] when they came to Spain gave it the [[Latin]] name of [[Hispalis]]. Over time this changed to be spelled in English as ''Seville''. The Arab [[Moors]] took the city when they invaded the country, and you can still see a lot of the buildings they built during their 800-year stay in Spain ([[711]]-[[1492]]).  In [[1992]] Seville was the place for the [[Expo 92]]. There is a beautiful bridge across the Guadalquivir River called ''Puente del Alamillo''. It was thought up by [[Santiago Calatrava]] a famous building expert.  Seville is famous for its hot summer weather.  == Education == * [[University of Seville]].
