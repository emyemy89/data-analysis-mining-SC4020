FC stands for "'''F'''ootbal '''C'''lub".</ref> is a [[Association football|football]] club that plays in the [[Premier League]]. They play their home games at [[Old Trafford]] which is in [[Greater Manchester]].  [[Matt Busby]] led the club to lots of success by using the youth players until the [[Munich air disaster]] in 1958, where many United footballers and staff died. [[Sir Alex Ferguson]] led the club to many titles, including the treble ([[English Premier League|Premier League]], [[FA Cup]], and [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]), from 1986 to 2013, when he retired. The club has 3 [[UEFA Champions League]] titles, 20 league titles, 12 [[FA Cup]]s, and a [[FIFA Club World Cup]].  == History == Manchester United are the most successful club in [[England]] and have won 20 league titles, which is more than any other team. They have also won 12 [[FA Cup]]s and 3 [[European cup|European Cups]]. {| class="wikitable" align="right" |+'''Manchester United Name History''' !Years used !Name |- |1878-1892 |'''Newton Heath L&YR F.C.''' |- |1892-1902 |'''Newton Heath F.C.''' |- |1902-present |'''Manchester United F.C.''' |} The club started as '''Newton Heath L&YR F.C.''' in 1878. All of the team worked at [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] depot at [[Newton Heath]]. After nearly closing in 1902, [[John Henry Davies]] took over and changed the club's name to '''Manchester United F.C.'''. Manchester United made [[Matt Busby]] their manager after [[World War II]]. Matt Busby used the youth team to get new players, and this was very successful. The club won the [[Football League]] in 1956 and 1957. The success was stopped by the [[Munich air disaster]] in 1958, when eight of the club's players died. It was thought that the club might close, but it did not. They won [[the Football League]] in 1965 and 1967, and the [[European cup|European Cup]] in 1968.  === Sir Alex Ferguson era === [[File:Alex Ferguson.jpg|alt=Sir Alex Ferguson|thumb|Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United's home ground Old Trafford]] In 1986, manager [[Ron Atkinson]] was sacked by the club because they were in danger of being relegated. They brought in [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]]. He did not win anything for the first couple of years.  The team won their first trophy under Ferguson, the 1990 FA Cup, against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the replay after a 3-3 draw. The next season, United won the [[UEFA Cup Winners Cup]]. In 1993, Manchester United won the very first Premier League. In 1999, Manchester United won the treble, made of the Premier League, [[FA Cup]], and [[UEFA Champions League]]. Manchester United won the league 7 times again until Sir Alex Ferguson retired after the [[201213 Premier League|201213 season]]. From the [[200607 Premier League|200607 season]] to the [[200809 Premier League|200809 season]], Man United won the league 3 times in a row. The club also won its third UEFA Champions League in 2008 against [[Chelsea F.C.]], and almost won the next season as well but lost to [[F.C. Barcelona|FC Barcelona]] in the final. They won their first [[FIFA Club World Cup]] in December 2008.   === Recent history === [[David Moyes]] was made manager in 2013. In April 2014, he was sacked by the club and club legend [[Ryan Giggs]] became player-manager (when a player is also the manager at the same time). They finished in 7th place. In 2014, [[Louis van Gaal|Louis Van Gaal]] took over. He led United to a 4th-place finish. In 2015, after winning 3-0 against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], Man United reached 1st place for the first time in over two years. However, after losing 0-3 to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], they dropped to 3rd place. Van Gaal was sacked at the end of the season and [[Jos Mourinho]] replaced him. He then led the club to a [[League Cup]] and [[2016-17 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] victory in the 201617 season. Mourinho was sacked in December 2018 because of poor results and replaced by [[Ole Gunnar Solskjr|Ole Gunnar Solskjaer]].  == Honours == === Domestic === ==== League ==== * '''[[Football League First Division|First Division]]''' (until 1992) and '''[[English Premier League|Premier League]]:<ref name="premier_league" group="nb">When it was made in 1992, the [[English Premier League|Premier League]] became the 1st division of [[Football in England|English football]]; the [[Football League First Division|First]] and [[Football League Second Division|Second divisions]] then turned into the second and third tiers, respectively.

In the [[Second World War]], bombings damaged the stadium. While the stadium was being fixed, they played "home" games at [[Manchester City]]'s [[Maine Road]]. The stadium was converted to an all-seater stadium in 1993 for safety reasons, but the capacity fell to 44,000. In 1995, expansions in the North Stand raised the capacity to 55,000. In the middle of 1999, the East and West Stands were expanded to give the stadium a capacity of 67,000.
