He became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933, after a democratic [[election]] in 1932. He became ''[[Fhrer]]'' (leader) of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1934.  Hitler led the Nazi Party [[NSDAP]] from 1921. When in power the Nazis created a [[dictatorship]] called the [[Third Reich]]. In 1933, they blocked out all other [[political parties]]. This gave Hitler absolute power.  Hitler ordered the [[invasion]] of [[Poland]] in 1939, and this started [[World War II]].

In addition, 28.7 million [[soldiers]] and civilians died as a result of military action in  Europe.
