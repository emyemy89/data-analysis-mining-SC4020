It joins the Mississippi just north of the city of [[Saint Louis, Missouri]].  The Missouri has many important [[tributary|tributaries]], including the [[Yellowstone River]], the [[Platte River]], and the [[Kansas River]].  ==History==  The Missouri was very important for the [[Native Americans]] who lived on the Great Plains.
