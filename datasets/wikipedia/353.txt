<title>Natural resource</title><text>[[Image:Windmills D1-D4 - Thornton Bank.jpg|thumb|150px|The natural resource of wind drives these 5MW wind turbines on a [[wind farm]] in [[Belgium]]]]  A '''natural resource''' is what people can use which comes from the [[natural environment]]. Examples of natural resources are [[air]], [[water]], [[wood]], [[Crude oil|oil]], [[wind energy]], [[natural gas]], [[iron]], and [[coal]].   The dividing line between natural resources and man-made resources is not clear-cut. [[Hydro-electric energy]] is not a natural resource because people use [[turbine]]s to convert the energy from moving water. [[Petroleum]] and [[iron ore]]s are natural, but need work to make them into usable refined oil and [[steel]]. Atomic energy comes from metallic [[nuclear fuel]]<nowiki/>s, like fissionable [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]], but natural rocks need technical work to make them into these nuclear fuels.  == Supply == We often say there are two sorts of natural resources: renewable resources and non-renewable resources. *A [[renewable resource]] is one which can be used again and again. For example, [[soil]], [[sunlight]] and [[water]] are renewable resources. However, in some circumstances, even water is not renewable easily. [[Wood]] is a renewable resource, but it takes time to renew and in some places people use the land for something else. Soil, if it blows away, is not easy to renew. *A [[non-renewable resource]] is a resource that does not grow and come back, or a resource that would take a very long time to come back. For example, [[coal]] is a non-renewable resource. When we use coal, there is less coal afterward.  The non-renewable resource can be used directly (for example, burning oil to cook), or we can find a renewable resource to use (for example, using wind energy to make [[electricity]] to cook).   [[File:Flooded cropland in southwest Iowa.jpg|thumb|Soil, a natural resource for farming]] Most natural resources are limited. This means they will eventually run out. A perpetual resource has a never-ending supply. Some examples of perpetual resources include [[solar energy]], [[tidal energy]], and [[wind energy]].<ref>ASTM E60 ''E2114-08 Standard terminology for sustainability'', ASTM, 2008, pp. 611-618 ISBN 978-0-8031-572</ref> There may be a limit to how much can be taken in a given day or year, but that amount can be taken again next day or next year.   Some of the things influencing supply of resources include whether it is able to be [[Recycling|recycled]], and the availability of suitable substitutes for the material. Non-renewable resources cannot be recycled. For example, [[fossil fuel]]s cannot be recycled.  == Demand == The [[demand]] for resources can change with new [[technology]], new needs, and new [[economics]] (e.g. changes in cost of the resources). Some material can go completely out of use, if people do not want it any more. Demand of many natural resources is very high, but availability of some, such as [[precious metal]]s, is very low.  == Availability == Different places have different natural resources.  When people do not have a certain resource they need, they can either replace it with another resource, or [[trade]] with another country to get the resource.  People have sometimes [[war|fought]] to have them (for example, [[spice]]s, water, arable [[farmland]], [[gold]], or [[petroleum]]).  When people do not have some resources, their [[quality of life]] can get lower.  So, people protect resources.  When they can not get clean water, people may become [[disease|ill]]; if there is not enough wood, trees will be cut and the forest will disappear over time ([[deforestation]]); if there are not enough fish in a sea, people can die of [[starvation]].  Renewable resources include [[crop]]s, wind, hydroelectric power, fish, and [[sunlight]].  Many people carefully save their natural resources so that others can use them in future.  == References == {{reflist}}  == Other websites == *[http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/027ns_005.htm?id=mg19426051.200&print=true Earth's natural wealth]  [[Category:Natural resources| ]] [[Category:Economics]] [[Category:Factors of production]]</text>
