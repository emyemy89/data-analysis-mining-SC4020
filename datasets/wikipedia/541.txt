Web browsers are used by people to find and look at [[web site]]s on the [[Internet]]. The first web browser was created in 1990. Many different web browsers are available for free. All web browsers can go to websites but each browser has good things and bad things about it. For example, some browsers focus on [[Information security|data security]] and keeping computers safe from [[computer virus|viruses]]. Other browsers are made so that web pages appear on screen faster.

Every web page has a [[Uniform Resource Locator|web address]].  A web browser goes to a web page using a web address. It downloads the [[HTML]] file stored at that address. Its [[browser engine]] then reads and translates the HTML file. The browser will then show the webpage on the screen as text, [[image]]s and clickable [[Link|links]].  {{commonscat|Web browsers}}  == Other websites == * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgULe_we-J0 What is browser?
