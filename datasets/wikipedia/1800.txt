The term "caf" comes from the [[French language|French]] word meaning "coffee".  A caf setting is known as a casual social environment where you can find people reading [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s, playing board games, studying or chatting with others about current events. It is known also regarded as a place where information can be exchanged.  A caf is sometimes called a coffeehouse or a [[coffee]] shop or tea shop in [[English language|English]], a caf in [[French language|French]] and a bar in [[Italian language|Italian]]. (Cafe or caf is the common spelling used in English, French, Spanish, et al. however the word is spelled "caff" in Italian.) It shares some characteristics of a [[Bar (business)|bar]] and some characteristics of a [[restaurant]] given its selection of foods and beverages served, but is distinct from a [[cafeteria]] which is a type of restaurant where customers can choose from many dishes displayed on a serving line. In some countries, cafs are designed to more closely resemble restaurants whereby offering a range of hot meals and possibly licensed to serve [[alcohol]]. Most British cafs however, do not sell [[alcohol]] likely due to the prominent [[pub]] culture.  == Caf Variations == In the [[Netherlands]], [[cannabis]]-selling cafs face an uncertain future under a planned new law banning smoking in public places. The cafs, which attract millions of tourists each year, allow customers to buy [[marijuana]] over the counter and openly smoke it. The acronym CAFE, Cannabis and Fine Edibles is used in Canada to represent the largest retail chain in the Country, post-legalization.  A new type of caf, known as the [[Internet caf]], was introduced in the 1990s and went hand in hand with the rising prevalence of [[computers]] in society. [[Computers]] and [[Internet]] access in a contemporary atmosphere created a youthful, modern public space compared to existing locales including traditional bars and old-fashioned diners. Nowadays, many cafs offer public wireless [[Internet]] or even have computers, [[telephones]], and [[newspapers]] for customer use. Further integrating internet usage to the caf atmosphere, some stores like [[Starbucks]] allow you to order directly from your smartphone, tablet, or other devices through their free store app or websites online.  More recently alongside the growing popularity of geek and gaming culture, gaming cafs have also begun to open in cities worldwide. These cafs offer a library of board games and tabletop games, from childhood classics such as Monopoly to indie games, for customers to play at their leisure for a nominal fee.  Cafe is a place of Work and Food. You can get a combination of work place as well as hotel.  {{DEFAULTSORT:Cafe}} [[Category:Food and drink]] [[Category:Restaurants]]   {{stub}}</text>
