It uses both [[art]] and [[engineering]]. Examples include houses, [[church]]es, [[hotel]]s, [[office]] buildings, roads, [[viaduct]]s, [[tunnel]]s and [[bridge]]s.<ref>Architecture.

Architecture often overlaps with [[structural engineering]], and architects and engineers often work together.  __TOC__  == History == [[File:Saint Leonardo vault.PNG|thumb|Romanesque groin vault]] In the past, people built [[wikt:hut|hut]]s and wood [[house]]s to protect themselves from the weather. For safety, they were often close together. Great [[civilization]]s like the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians built large [[temples]] and structures, like the [[Great Pyramids of Giza]]. The [[Ancient Greek]]s and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s made what we now call "[[Classical architecture|Classical Architecture]]". The Romans, working over 2000 years ago, copied the [[arch]] from the [[Etruscans]], who copied it from the [[Mesopotamia]]ns.<ref>Risebero, Bill 2018. ''The story of Western architecture''.

New York: Wiley.</ref>   [[File:Former post office in Nemti.jpg|thumb|A simpler building, in [[Hungary]]]] '''Classical architecture''' was formal, and it always obeyed [[laws]]. It used [[symmetry]], which really means [[wikt:simple:balance|balance]], and it used [[proportion]] between shapes. The [[Golden ratio|Golden Mean]] was a rule which said, (to put it simply) if you are making a room, or any other thing, it will work best if you always make the long side 1.6 times as long as the short side.<ref>Ching, Francis; Jarzombek, Mark & Prakash, Vikram. 2006. ''A global history of architecture''. Wiley.</ref> There are many 'laws' in classical architecture, like how high the middle of an arched [[bridge]] needs to be (which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be). These laws were learned from thousands of [[year]]s of experience and they are often used today. However, today more notice is taken of specific facts, such as what wind speeds occur once or twice in a century. [[Tay Bridge disaster|Several bridges have blown down]] because that was not properly taken into consideration.  In some parts of the world, like [[India]], the architecture is famous for [[carving]] the stone on temples and palaces. Different architectural styles occur in [[China]], [[Japan]], Southeast Asia, [[Africa]], [[Mexico]], and Central and [[South America]].  Architects in [[Western Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]] made [[Romanesque architecture]], then [[Gothic architecture]]. Gothic buildings have tall, pointed [[window]]s and arches. Many [[Church (building)|church]]es have Gothic architecture. [[Castle]]s were also built at this time. In [[Eastern Europe]], churches usually had [[dome]]s. People added their own ideas and [[decoration]] to the Classical Architecture of the past. The [[Renaissance]] brought a return to classical ideas.  [[File:NYC - Guggenheim Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Architecture can have many styles, such as the curved [[Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York City]]]] In the late 18th century with the [[Industrial Revolution]], people began to [[invent]] machines to make things quickly and cheaply. Many [[factory|factories]] and [[Mill (factory)|mills]] were built during, or after this revolution. Decades later, in the [[Victorian era]], architects like [[George Fowler Jones]] and [[Decimus Burton]] still followed the Gothic style to build new churches. Up to this point, buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and [[masonry]] used to construct them. Gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with [[buttress]]es allowed stone buildings to be built taller. For example, the cathedral in [[Ulm]], Germany is over 500 feet tall. However, building with stone has its limits, and building too tall could result in collapse. This happened to the [[Beauvais Cathedral]], which was never completed.  [[File:Sears Tower ss.jpg|thumb|New technology allows new kinds of buildings such as for the [[Willis Tower]] in [[Chicago]]]]  Towards the end of the 19th Century with a second Industrial Revolution, [[steel]] became much cheaper. Architects began to use inventions like metal girders and [[reinforced concrete]] to build. An example is the [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]]. Buildings can now be built taller than ever before. We call them [[skyscrapers]]. This new [[technology]] has made us free from traditional limitations, and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials, many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated, replaced, or abandoned. Cheap, strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls, especially for office buildings.  [[Modernism]] is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies, and its beginnings can been seen as early as 1890. Modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late 20th century, and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then, which are sometimes called "post-modern".  Many of the world's greatest structures were built by modern-day architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]; Sir [[Hugh Casson]]; [[Norman Foster]]; [[I. M. Pei]]; [[Adrian Smith (architect)|Adrian Smith]]; [[Edward Durell Stone]]; [[Frank Gehry]]; [[Fazlur Khan]]; [[Gottfried Bhm]]; and [[Bruce Graham]].  == Related pages == * [[Architect]] * [[Art]] * [[List of buildings]] * [[Skyscraper]] * [[Structural Engineering]] * [[Acoustics]] * [[Building code]] * [[Building materials]] * [[Pattern language]] * [[World Heritage Site]]s  == References == {{reflist}}  ==Other websites== {{commonscat}} * [http://www.aia.org/index.htm American Institute of Architects] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818185034/http://www.aia.org/index.htm |date=2015-08-18 }} * [http://www.architecture.com.au/ Australian Institute of Architects] * [http://www.architecture.com/Home.aspx Royal Institute of British Architects] * [http://www.raic.org/ Royal Architectural Institute of Canada] * [http://www.nzia.co.nz/ New Zealand Institute of Architects] * [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Architecture Architecture] Citizendium  [[Category:Architecture| ]] [[Category:Architecture sciences]] [[Category:Construction]]</text>
