<title>Carl Sagan</title><text>Carl Edward Sagan (November 9, 1934 - December 20, 1996) was an American astronomer. He tried to make science popular. He thought about what life from other planets would be like. He said that people should look for life on other planets (SETI). He is world famous for his popular science books and the television series Cosmos, which he co-wrote and presented. He said people should use the scientific method.[[File:Carl Sagan Planetary Society.JPG|right|thumb|Carl Sagan]]   == Education and work ==  Carl Sagan was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] where his father, Sam Sagan, was a [[Jewish]] clothes maker and his mother, Rachel Molly Gruber, was a housewife. Sagan attended the [[University of Chicago]] earning two degrees in physics.  He followed with a doctorate in Astronomy in 1960 and taught at [[Harvard University]] until 1968, when he moved to [[Cornell University]].  Sagan became a teacher and director at Cornell in 1971. He helped many unmanned spacecraft to explore outer space. He thought of the idea of putting a message on spacecraft which could be understood by any life from another [[planet]] that might find it. The first message sent into space was a large gold-plated [[Pioneer plaque|label]] on the space probe [[Pioneer 10]]. He continued to make the messages better. The last message he helped with was the [[Voyager Golden Record]] that was sent out with the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] space probes.  == Scientific achievements ==  He was well known as a writer who warned of the dangers of [[nuclear winter]]. He helped people learn about the atmosphere of [[Venus (planet)|Venus]], seasonal changes on [[Mars (planet)|Mars]], and Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. He showed that the atmosphere of Venus is very hot and dense. He also said that [[global warming]] was a growing, man-made danger like the natural development of [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] into a hot and dangerous planet with [[greenhouse gas]]es. He suggested that the seasonal changes on Mars were due to dust storms.  Sagan was among the first to guess that Titan and Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] might have oceans or lakes, which means that [[life]] could be there. Europa's underground ocean was later confirmed by the spacecraft [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]].  Sagan thought the search for life on other planets was a good idea. He said scientists should listen with large [[radio telescope]]s for signals from other planets. He thought sending probes to other planets was a good idea. Sagan was editor ''Icarus'' (a magazine about space exploration) for 12 years. He helped start the ''[[Planetary Society]]'' and was a member of the SETI Institute Board of Trustees.  == Social concerns ==  Sagan also believed that the [[Drake equation]] suggested that many kinds of intelligent life could form, but that the lack of evidence (the [[Fermi paradox]]) suggests that intelligent beings destroy themselves rather quickly. This made him keen to talk about ways that humanity could destroy itself, in the hope of avoiding such destruction.  Under the name "Mr. X," Sagan wrote about [[pot]] smoking in the 1971 book ''Reconsidering [[Marijuana]]''. [[Lester Grinspoon]] (the book's editor), told this to Keay Davidson, Sagan's biographer. Sagan said that [[marijuana]] helped him write some of his books.  == Making science popular ==  Sagan was very good at helping people to understand the cosmos. He gave the 1977/1978 Christmas Lectures for Young People at the [[Royal Institution]]. He wrote (with [[Ann Druyan]], who became his third wife) and made the very popular thirteen-part [[PBS]] television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]''; he also wrote books to help science become more popular (''[[The Dragons of Eden]]'', which won a [[Pulitzer Prize]], ''Broca's Brain'', etc.) and a novel, ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]'', that was a best-seller and was made into a [[Contact (movie)|film]] starring [[Jodie Foster]] in 1997. The film won the 1998 [[Hugo Award]].  After ''Cosmos'', Sagan was linked with the catchphrase "billions and billions", which he never used in the television series (but he often used the word "billions"). He wrote ''Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space'', which was chosen as a notable book of 1995 by The ''[[New York Times]]''.  Not all scientists agreed with him. Although they all liked the way he made science popular, some were afraid that people would think that his personal opinions might be confused with real science. What he said about the [[Kuwaiti oil fires|Kuwait oil well fires]] during the first Gulf War were shown later to be wrong.  Later in his life, Sagan's books showed his skeptical, naturalistic view of the world. In his book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'', Sagan gave a list of mistakes he had made as an example of how science is self-correcting. The compilation ''Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the End of the Millennium'', published after Sagan's death, contains essays written by Sagan, such as his views on [[abortion]], and Ann Druyan's account of his death as a non-believer.  == Legacy ==  After a long and difficult fight with [[myelodysplasia]], Sagan died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 62, on December 20, 1996, at the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] in [[Seattle, Washington]]. Sagan was very important, because he made science popular, and changed the way science was organized, and because he defended [[humanism]], and argued against seeing things from only one point of view.  The landing site of the unmanned [[Mars Pathfinder]] spacecraft was renamed the ''Carl Sagan Memorial Station'' in honor of Dr. Sagan on July 5, 1997. [[2709 Sagan|Asteroid 2709 Sagan]] is also named in his honor.  The 1997 movie ''Contact'' (see above), based on Sagan's novel of the same name, and finished after his death, ends with the dedication "For Carl."  == Awards and medals ==  * [[Apollo Achievement Award]] - [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] * [[Chicken Little]] Honorable Mention - 1991 - National Anxiety Center * Distinguished Public Service - National Aeronautics and Space Administration * [[Emmy]] - Outstanding individual achievement - 1981 - PBS series ''Cosmos'' * Emmy - Outstanding Informational Series - 1981 - PBS series ''Cosmos'' * Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal - National Aeronautics and Space Administration * [[Helen Caldicott Leadership Award]] - Women's Action for Nuclear Disarmament * [[Homer Award]] - 1997 - ''Contact'' * [[Hugo Award]] - 1998 - ''Contact'' * Hugo Award - 1981 - ''Cosmos'' * Hugo Award - 1997 - ''The Demon-Haunted World'' * In Praise of Reason Award - 1987 - Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal * Isaac Asimov Award - 1994 - Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal * John F.
