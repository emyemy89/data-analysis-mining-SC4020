<title>Relative humidity</title><text>'''Relative humidity''' is a way of describing how much [[humidity]] is present in the air, compared to how much there could be. [[Meteorologist]]s often use the relative humidity as a [[measurement]] to describe the [[weather]] at various places.  When the [[temperature]] is warm, more [[water vapor]] can be in the air than when it is cold. If the actual amount of vapor is compared to the total amount there could be as a fraction, then the [[number]] tells if the [[air]] feels dry or moist. The value is usually written in [[percent]], where 0% means that the air is totally dry, and 100% means that it is so moist that [[mist]] or [[dew]] is about to form.  When the temperature is lowered to the [[dew point]], relative humidity become 100% and the water vapor  [[condensation|condenses]], making [[precipitation]] as [[dew]], [[rain]] or [[snow]] (etc.).   {{weather-stub}}  [[Category:Weather measurements]] [[Category:Meteorology]]  [[cs:Vlhkost vzduchu#Relativn (pomrn) vlhkost vzduchu]]</text>
